    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.functional.embedding_bag]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [Compute sums, means or maxes of `bags` of embeddings.

    Calculation is done without instantiating the intermediate embeddings.
    See :class:`torch.nn.EmbeddingBag` for more details.

    Note:
        This operation may produce nondeterministic gradients when given tensors on a CUDA device. See :doc:`/notes/randomness` for more information.

    Args:
        input (LongTensor): Tensor containing bags of indices into the embedding matrix
        weight (Tensor): The embedding matrix with number of rows equal to the maximum possible index + 1,
            and number of columns equal to the embedding size
        offsets (LongTensor, optional): Only used when :attr:`input` is 1D. :attr:`offsets` determines
                             the starting index position of each bag (sequence) in :attr:`input`.
        max_norm (float, optional): If given, each embedding vector with norm larger than :attr:`max_norm`
                                    is renormalized to have norm :attr:`max_norm`.
                                    Note: this will modify :attr:`weight` in-place.
        norm_type (float, optional): The ``p`` in the ``p``-norm to compute for the :attr:`max_norm` option.
                                     Default ``2``.
        scale_grad_by_freq (bool, optional): if given, this will scale gradients by the inverse of frequency of
                                                the words in the mini-batch. Default ``False``.
                                                Note: this option is not supported when ``mode="max"``.
        mode (str, optional): ``"sum"``, ``"mean"`` or ``"max"``. Specifies the way to reduce the bag.
                                 Default: ``"mean"``
        sparse (bool, optional): if ``True``, gradient w.r.t. :attr:`weight` will be a sparse tensor. See Notes under
                                 :class:`torch.nn.Embedding` for more details regarding sparse gradients.
                                 Note: this option is not supported when ``mode="max"``.
        per_sample_weights (Tensor, optional): a tensor of float / double weights, or None
            to indicate all weights should be taken to be 1. If specified, :attr:`per_sample_weights`
            must have exactly the same shape as input and is treated as having the same
            :attr:`offsets`, if those are not None.

        include_last_offset (bool, optional): if ``True``, the size of offsets is equal to the number of bags + 1.
            The last element is the size of the input, or the ending index position of the last bag (sequence).

        padding_idx (int, optional): If specified, the entries at :attr:`padding_idx` do not contribute to the
                                     gradient; therefore, the embedding vector at :attr:`padding_idx` is not updated
                                     during training, i.e. it remains as a fixed "pad". Note that the embedding
                                     vector at :attr:`padding_idx` is excluded from the reduction.

    Shape:
        - :attr:`input` (LongTensor) and :attr:`offsets` (LongTensor, optional)

          - If :attr:`input` is 2D of shape `(B, N)`, it will be treated as ``B`` bags (sequences)
            each of fixed length ``N``, and this will return ``B`` values aggregated in a way
            depending on the :attr:`mode`. :attr:`offsets` is ignored and required to be ``None`` in this case.

          - If :attr:`input` is 1D of shape `(N)`, it will be treated as a concatenation of
            multiple bags (sequences). :attr:`offsets` is required to be a 1D tensor containing
            the starting index positions of each bag in :attr:`input`. Therefore, for :attr:`offsets`
            of shape `(B)`, :attr:`input` will be viewed as having ``B`` bags.
            Empty bags (i.e., having 0-length) will have returned vectors filled by zeros.

        - :attr:`weight` (Tensor): the learnable weights of the module of shape `(num_embeddings, embedding_dim)`

        - :attr:`per_sample_weights` (Tensor, optional). Has the same shape as :attr:`input`.

        - :attr:`output`: aggregated embedding values of shape `(B, embedding_dim)`

    Examples::

        >>> # an Embedding module containing 10 tensors of size 3
        >>> embedding_matrix = torch.rand(10, 3)
        >>> # a batch of 2 samples of 4 indices each
        >>> input = torch.tensor([1, 2, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 9])
        >>> offsets = torch.tensor([0, 4])
        >>> # xdoctest: +IGNORE_WANT("non-deterministic")
        >>> F.embedding_bag(input, embedding_matrix, offsets)
        tensor([[ 0.3397,  0.3552,  0.5545],
                [ 0.5893,  0.4386,  0.5882]])

        >>> # example with padding_idx
        >>> embedding_matrix = torch.rand(10, 3)
        >>> input = torch.tensor([2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 3, 2, 9])
        >>> offsets = torch.tensor([0, 4])
        >>> F.embedding_bag(input, embedding_matrix, offsets, padding_idx=2, mode='sum')
        tensor([[ 0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000],
                [-0.7082,  3.2145, -2.6251]])
    ]

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly specified for the API to function correctly.  
    - "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": Pairs of parameters that cannot be used together in a single call due to logical or operational conflicts.  
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" refer to parameter pairs that are not universally mutually exclusive but become incompatible only under specific conditions. In these cases, the mutual exclusion depends on certain value combinations, e.g., the parameters conflict only when both assume particular values or satisfy certain conditions based on their assigned values. Thus, these are a subset of "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" that exhibit conditional, rather than absolute, exclusivity.
    - "Mandatory coexistence parameters": Sets of parameters that must be provided together to ensure valid configuration or meaningful behavior.
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters": When the parameters meet certain conditions, it will prevent the function from running.

    3. Your Tasks:

    Based on the documentation and definitions provided:

    1. Determine the Type of Each Parameter.
    For each explicitly defined parameter in [fun_string], determine its type, such as: tensor, int, str, optional tensor, etc.
    2. Identify Parameter Dependency Structures as accurately and completely as possible:
    - List all "Mandatory Parameters"  
    - Identify any "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs"  
    - Identify any "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" 
    - Identify any "Mandatory Coexistence Parameters"

    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.functional.grid_sample]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [Compute grid sample.

    Given an :attr:`input` and a flow-field :attr:`grid`, computes the
    ``output`` using :attr:`input` values and pixel locations from :attr:`grid`.

    Currently, only spatial (4-D) and volumetric (5-D) :attr:`input` are
    supported.

    In the spatial (4-D) case, for :attr:`input` with shape
    :math:`(N, C, H_\text{in}, W_\text{in})` and :attr:`grid` with shape
    :math:`(N, H_\text{out}, W_\text{out}, 2)`, the output will have shape
    :math:`(N, C, H_\text{out}, W_\text{out})`.

    For each output location ``output[n, :, h, w]``, the size-2 vector
    ``grid[n, h, w]`` specifies :attr:`input` pixel locations ``x`` and ``y``,
    which are used to interpolate the output value ``output[n, :, h, w]``.
    In the case of 5D inputs, ``grid[n, d, h, w]`` specifies the
    ``x``, ``y``, ``z`` pixel locations for interpolating
    ``output[n, :, d, h, w]``. :attr:`mode` argument specifies ``nearest`` or
    ``bilinear`` interpolation method to sample the input pixels.

    :attr:`grid` specifies the sampling pixel locations normalized by the
    :attr:`input` spatial dimensions. Therefore, it should have most values in
    the range of ``[-1, 1]``. For example, values ``x = -1, y = -1`` is the
    left-top pixel of :attr:`input`, and values  ``x = 1, y = 1`` is the
    right-bottom pixel of :attr:`input`.

    If :attr:`grid` has values outside the range of ``[-1, 1]``, the corresponding
    outputs are handled as defined by :attr:`padding_mode`. Options are

        * ``padding_mode="zeros"``: use ``0`` for out-of-bound grid locations,
        * ``padding_mode="border"``: use border values for out-of-bound grid locations,
        * ``padding_mode="reflection"``: use values at locations reflected by
          the border for out-of-bound grid locations. For location far away
          from the border, it will keep being reflected until becoming in bound,
          e.g., (normalized) pixel location ``x = -3.5`` reflects by border ``-1``
          and becomes ``x' = 1.5``, then reflects by border ``1`` and becomes
          ``x'' = -0.5``.

    Note:
        This function is often used in conjunction with :func:`affine_grid`
        to build `Spatial Transformer Networks`_ .

    Note:
        When using the CUDA backend, this operation may induce nondeterministic
        behaviour in its backward pass that is not easily switched off.
        Please see the notes on :doc:`/notes/randomness` for background.

    Note:
        NaN values in :attr:`grid` would be interpreted as ``-1``.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): input of shape :math:`(N, C, H_\text{in}, W_\text{in})` (4-D case)
                        or :math:`(N, C, D_\text{in}, H_\text{in}, W_\text{in})` (5-D case)
        grid (Tensor): flow-field of shape :math:`(N, H_\text{out}, W_\text{out}, 2)` (4-D case)
                       or :math:`(N, D_\text{out}, H_\text{out}, W_\text{out}, 3)` (5-D case)
        mode (str): interpolation mode to calculate output values
            ``'bilinear'`` | ``'nearest'`` | ``'bicubic'``. Default: ``'bilinear'``
            Note: ``mode='bicubic'`` supports only 4-D input.
            When ``mode='bilinear'`` and the input is 5-D, the interpolation mode
            used internally will actually be trilinear. However, when the input is 4-D,
            the interpolation mode will legitimately be bilinear.
        padding_mode (str): padding mode for outside grid values
            ``'zeros'`` | ``'border'`` | ``'reflection'``. Default: ``'zeros'``
        align_corners (bool, optional): Geometrically, we consider the pixels of the
            input  as squares rather than points.
            If set to ``True``, the extrema (``-1`` and ``1``) are considered as referring
            to the center points of the input's corner pixels. If set to ``False``, they
            are instead considered as referring to the corner points of the input's corner
            pixels, making the sampling more resolution agnostic.
            This option parallels the ``align_corners`` option in
            :func:`interpolate`, and so whichever option is used here
            should also be used there to resize the input image before grid sampling.
            Default: ``False``

    Returns:
        output (Tensor): output Tensor

    .. _`Spatial Transformer Networks`:
        https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02025

    .. warning::
        When ``align_corners = True``, the grid positions depend on the pixel
        size relative to the input image size, and so the locations sampled by
        :func:`grid_sample` will differ for the same input given at different
        resolutions (that is, after being upsampled or downsampled).
        The default behavior up to version 1.2.0 was ``align_corners = True``.
        Since then, the default behavior has been changed to ``align_corners = False``,
        in order to bring it in line with the default for :func:`interpolate`.

    .. note::
        ``mode='bicubic'`` is implemented using the `cubic convolution algorithm`_ with :math:`\alpha=-0.75`.
        The constant :math:`\alpha` might be different from packages to packages.
        For example, `PIL`_ and `OpenCV`_ use -0.5 and -0.75 respectively.
        This algorithm may "overshoot" the range of values it's interpolating.
        For example, it may produce negative values or values greater than 255 when interpolating input in [0, 255].
        Clamp the results with :func:`torch.clamp` to ensure they are within the valid range.

    3. Your Tasks:

    Based on the documentation and definitions provided:

    1. Determine the Type of Each Parameter.
    For each explicitly defined parameter in [fun_string], determine its type, such as: tensor, int, str, optional tensor, etc.
    2. Identify Parameter Interdependencies.
    Identify all interdependencies among the parameters, including mandatory parameters, mutual exclusions, conditional mutual exclusions, and mandatory coexistence parameters.
    3. Provide a Summary of Findings.
    Summarize the findings in a clear and concise manner, highlighting the key interdependencies and their implications for API usage.

    The parameters to analyze are: input, grid, mode, padding_mode, align_corners.

    The output should be structured as follows:

    1. Parameter Type Identification:
        - For each parameter, specify its type.
    2. Parameter Interdependencies:
        - List all mandatory parameters.
        - List all mutual exclusion parameter pairs.
        - List all conditional mutual exclusion parameter pairs.
        - List all mandatory coexistence parameters.
    3. Summary:
        - Summarize the key points.

    The output should be in English.
</think>

### 1. Parameter Type Identification

- **input**: Tensor  
- **grid**: Tensor  
- **mode**: str  
- **padding_mode**: str  
- **align_corners**: bool, optional  

### 2. Parameter Interdependencies

#### Mandatory Parameters:
- **input**: Must be provided as the input tensor.
- **grid**: Must be provided as the flow-field tensor.

#### Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs:
- None explicitly defined in the documentation.

#### Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs:
- **mode** and **align_corners**: The behavior of `align_corners` depends on the `mode` parameter. For example, when `mode='bicubic'`, `align_corners` may have different implications compared to `mode='bilinear'`.

#### Mandatory Coexistence Parameters:
- **mode** and **align_corners**: While not strictly mandatory together, their interaction is significant. For instance, `align_corners` affects the sampling behavior, which is influenced by the interpolation `mode`.

### 3. Summary

The `grid_sample` function in PyTorch requires the `input` and `grid` tensors as mandatory parameters. The `mode`, `padding_mode`, and `align_corners` parameters are optional but influence the interpolation behavior. Notably, `align_corners` interacts conditionally with `mode`, affecting how grid points are interpreted. There are no strict mutual exclusions, but the parameters' values can influence each other's behavior, especially in terms of interpolation and grid alignment. Users should ensure consistent use of these parameters, particularly when combining `align_corners` with different `mode` settings, to achieve the desired sampling results.

    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.sparse_coo_tensor]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [sparse_coo_tensor(indices, values, size=None, *, dtype=None, device=None, pin_memory=False, requires_grad=False, check_invariants=None, is_coalesced=None) -> Tensor

Constructs a :ref:`sparse tensor in COO(rdinate) format
<sparse-coo-docs>` with specified values at the given
:attr:`indices`.

.. note::

   This function returns an :ref:`uncoalesced tensor
   <sparse-uncoalesced-coo-docs>` when :attr:`is_coalesced` is
   unspecified or ``None``.

.. note::

   If the ``device`` argument is not specified the device of the given
   :attr:`values` and indices tensor(s) must match. If, however, the
   argument is specified the input Tensors will be converted to the
   given device and in turn determine the device of the constructed
   sparse tensor.

Args:
    indices (array_like): Initial data for the tensor. Can be a list, tuple,
        NumPy ``ndarray``, scalar, and other types. Will be cast to a :class:`torch.LongTensor`
        internally. The indices are the coordinates of the non-zero values in the matrix, and thus
        should be two-dimensional where the first dimension is the number of tensor dimensions and
        the second dimension is the number of non-zero values.
    values (array_like): Initial values for the tensor. Can be a list, tuple,
        NumPy ``ndarray``, scalar, and other types.
    size (list, tuple, or :class:`torch.Size`, optional): Size of the sparse tensor. If not
        provided the size will be inferred as the minimum size big enough to hold all non-zero
        elements.

Keyword args:
    dtype (:class:`torch.dtype`, optional): the desired data type of returned tensor.
        Default: if None, infers data type from :attr:`values`.
    device (:class:`torch.device`, optional): the desired device of returned tensor.
        Default: if None, uses the current device for the default tensor type
        (see :func:`torch.set_default_device`). :attr:`device` will be the CPU
        for CPU tensor types and the current CUDA device for CUDA tensor types.
    pin_memory (bool, optional): If set, returned tensor would be allocated in
        the pinned memory. Works only for CPU tensors. Default: ``False``.
    requires_grad (bool, optional): If autograd should record operations on the
        returned tensor. Default: ``False``.
    check_invariants (bool, optional): If sparse tensor invariants are checked.
        Default: as returned by :func:`torch.sparse.check_sparse_tensor_invariants.is_enabled`,
        initially False.
    is_coalesced (bool, optional): When``True``, the caller is
        responsible for providing tensor indices that correspond to a
        coalesced tensor.  If the :attr:`check_invariants` flag is
        False, no error will be raised if the prerequisites are not
        met and this will lead to silently incorrect results. To force
        coalescion please use :meth:`coalesce` on the resulting
        Tensor.
        Default: None: except for trivial cases (e.g. nnz < 2) the
        resulting Tensor has is_coalesced set to ``False```.

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly specified for the API to function correctly.  
    - "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": Pairs of parameters that cannot be used together in a single call due to logical or operational conflicts.  
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" refer to parameter pairs that are not universally mutually exclusive but become incompatible only under specific conditions. In these cases, the mutual exclusion depends on certain value combinations, e.g., the parameters conflict only when both assume particular values or satisfy certain conditions based on their assigned values. Thus, these are a subset of "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" that exhibit conditional, rather than absolute, exclusivity.
    - "Mandatory coexistence parameters": Sets of parameters that must be provided together to ensure valid configuration or meaningful behavior.
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters": When the parameters meet certain conditions, it will prevent the function from running.

    1. Role:
        You are an expert in [torch], with deep knowledge of its API design, functionality, and practical usage across a wide range of scenarios.

    ---
    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.load]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [load(f, map_location=None, pickle_module=pickle, *, weights_only=False, mmap=None, **pickle_load_args)

    Loads an object saved with :func:`torch.save` from a file.

    :func:`torch.load` uses Python's unpickling facilities but treats storages,
    which underlie tensors, specially. They are first deserialized on the
    CPU and are then moved to the device they were saved from. If this fails
    (e.g. because the run time system doesn't have certain devices), an exception
    is raised. However, storages can be dynamically remapped to an alternative
    set of devices using the :attr:`map_location` argument.

    If :attr:`map_location` is a callable, it will be called once for each serialized
    storage with two arguments: storage and location. The storage argument
    will be the initial deserialization of the storage, residing on the CPU.
    Each serialized storage has a location tag associated with it which
    identifies the device it was saved from, and this tag is the second
    argument passed to :attr:`map_location`. The builtin location tags are ``'cpu'``
    for CPU tensors and ``'cuda:device_id'`` (e.g. ``'cuda:2'``) for CUDA tensors.
    :attr:`map_location` should return either ``None`` or a storage. If
    :attr:`map_location` returns a storage, it will be used as the final deserialized
    object, already moved to the right device. Otherwise, :func:`torch.load` will
    fall back to the default behavior, as if :attr:`map_location` wasn't specified.

    If :attr:`map_location` is a :class:`torch.device` object or a string containing
    a device tag, it indicates the location where all tensors should be loaded.

    Otherwise, if :attr:`map_location` is a dict, it will be used to remap location tags
    appearing in the file (keys), to ones that specify where to put the
    storages (values).

    User extensions can register their own location tags and tagging and
    deserialization methods using :func:`torch.serialization.register_package`.

    Args:
        f: a file-like object (has to implement :meth:`read`, :meth:`readline`, :meth:`tell`, and :meth:`seek`),
            or a string or os.PathLike object containing a file name
        map_location: a function, :class:`torch.device`, string or a dict specifying how to remap storage
            locations
        pickle_module: module used for unpickling metadata and objects (has to
            match the :attr:`pickle_module` used to serialize file)
        weights_only: Indicates whether unpickler should be restricted to
            loading only tensors, primitive types, dictionaries
            and any types added via :func:`torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.
        mmap: Indicates whether the file should be mmaped rather than loading all the storages into memory.
            Typically, tensor storages in the file will first be moved from disk to CPU memory, after which they
            are moved to the location that they were tagged with when saving, or specified by ``map_location``. This
            second step is a no-op if the final location is CPU. When the ``mmap`` flag is set, instead of copying the
            tensor storages from disk to CPU memory in the first step, ``f`` is mmaped.
        pickle_load_args: (Python 3 only) optional keyword arguments passed over to
            :func:`pickle_module.load` and :func:`pickle_module.Unpickler`, e.g.,
            :attr:`errors=...`.

    .. warning::
        :func:`torch.load()` unless `weights_only` parameter is set to `True`,
        uses ``pickle`` module implicitly, which is known to be insecure.
        It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code
        during unpickling. Never load data that could have come from an untrusted
        source in an unsafe mode, or that could have been tampered with. **Only load data you trust**.

    .. note::
        When you call :func:`torch.load()` on a file which contains GPU tensors, those tensors
        will be loaded to GPU by default. You can call ``torch.load(.., map_location='cpu')``
        and then :meth:`load_state_dict` to avoid GPU RAM surge when loading a model checkpoint.

    .. note::
        By default, we decode byte strings as ``utf-8``.  This is to avoid a common error
        case ``UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0x...``
        when loading files saved by Python 2 in Python 3.  If this default
        is incorrect, you may use an extra :attr:`encoding` keyword argument to specify how
        these objects should be loaded, e.g., :attr:`encoding='latin1'` decodes them
        to strings using ``latin1`` encoding, and :attr:`encoding='bytes'` keeps them
        as byte arrays which can be decoded later with ``byte_array.decode(...)``.

    Example:
        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("undefined filepaths")
        >>> torch.load("tensors.pt", weights_only=True)
        # Load all tensors onto the CPU
        >>> torch.load("tensors.pt", map_location=torch.device("cpu"), weights_only=True)
        # Load all tensors onto the CPU, using a function
        >>> torch.load(
        ...     "tensors.pt", map_location=lambda storage, loc: storage, weights_only=True
        ... )
        # Load all tensors onto GPU 1
        >>> torch.load(
        ...     "tensors.pt",
        ...     map_location=lambda storage, loc: storage.cuda(1),
        ...     weights_only=True,
        ... )  # type: ignore[attr-defined]
        # Map tensors from GPU 1 to GPU 0
        >>> torch.load("tensors.pt", map_location={"cuda:1": "cuda:0"}, weights_only=True)
        # Load tensor from io.BytesIO object
        # Loading from a buffer setting weights_only=False, warning this can be unsafe
        >>> with open("tensor.pt", "rb") as f:
        ...     buffer = io.BytesIO(f.read())
        >>> torch.load(buffer, weights_only=False)
        # Load a module with 'ascii' encoding for unpickling
        # Loading from a module setting weights_only=False, warning this can be unsafe
        >>> torch.load("module.pt", encoding="ascii", weights_only=False)
    ]

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly specified for the API to function correctly.  
    - "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": Pairs of parameters that cannot be used together in a single call due to logical or operational conflicts.  
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" refer to parameter pairs that are not universally mutually exclusive but become incompatible only under specific conditions. In these cases, the mutual exclusion depends on certain value combinations, e.g., the parameters conflict only when both assume particular values or satisfy certain conditions based on their assigned values. Thus, these are a subset of "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" that exhibit conditional, rather than absolute, exclusivity.
    - "Mandatory coexistence parameters": Sets of parameters that must be provided together to ensure valid configuration or meaningful behavior.
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters": When the parameters meet certain conditions, it will prevent the function from running.

    Based on the documentation and definitions provided:

    1. Determine the Type of Each Parameter.
    For each explicitly defined parameter in [fun_string], determine its type, such as: tensor, int, str, optional tensor, etc.
    2. Identify Parameter Dependency Structures as accurately and completely as possible:
    - List all "Mandatory Parameters"  
    - Identify any "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs"  
    - Identify any "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" 
    - Identify any "Mandatory Coexistence Parameters"

    {
    "Parameter type": {
        "input": "...",
        "weight": "...",
        "bias": "...",
        "stride": "...",

    },

    "Mandatory Coexistence Parameters": [["...", "...", "..."], ["...", "..."], ...],
    "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters":["para_1", "para_2","(para_1>1)&(para_2>1)"] 
    }

    ---
    5.Examples:

    For example, for the API [torch.nn.Conv2d], the output would be:

    {
    "Parameter type": {
        "input": "Tensor",
        "weight": "Tensor",
        "bias": "Tensor",
        "stride": "int or tuple",
        "padding": "int or tuple",
        "dilation": "int or tuple",
        "groups": "int"
    },
    "Mandatory Parameters": ["input"],
    "Mutually Exclusive Parameter Pairs": [["bias", "groups"], ...],
    "Mandatory Coexistence Parameters": [["stride", "padding"], ...],
    "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters":["para_1", "para_2","(para_1>1)&(para_2>1)"] 
    }

    Note: The example is illustrative and not based on actual API parameters.

    Now, apply this to the [torch.load] API.

    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.unique]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [unique(input, sorted=True, return_inverse=False, return_counts=False, dim=None) -> Tuple[Tensor, Tensor, Tensor]

    Returns the unique elements of the input tensor.

    .. note:: This function is different from :func:`torch.unique_consecutive` in the sense that
        this function also eliminates non-consecutive duplicate values.

    .. note:: Currently in the CUDA implementation and the CPU implementation,
        `torch.unique` always sort the tensor at the beginning regardless of the `sort` argument.
        Sorting could be slow, so if your input tensor is already sorted, it is recommended to use
        :func:`torch.unique_consecutive` which avoids the sorting.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): the input tensor
        sorted (bool): Whether to sort the unique elements in ascending order
            before returning as output.
        return_inverse (bool): Whether to also return the indices for where
            elements in the original input ended up in the returned unique list.
        return_counts (bool): Whether to also return the counts for each unique
            element.
        dim (int, optional): the dimension to operate upon. If ``None``, the
            unique of the flattened input is returned. Otherwise, each of the
            tensors indexed by the given dimension is treated as one of the
            elements to apply the unique operation upon. See examples for more
            details. Default: ``None``

    Returns:
        (Tensor, Tensor (optional), Tensor (optional)): A tensor or a tuple of tensors containing

            - **output** (*Tensor*): the output list of unique scalar elements.
            - **inverse_indices** (*Tensor*): (optional) if
              :attr:`return_inverse` is True, there will be an additional
              returned tensor (same shape as input) representing the indices
              for where elements in the original input map to in the output;
              otherwise, this function will only return a single tensor.
            - **counts** (*Tensor*): (optional) if
              :attr:`return_counts` is True, there will be an additional
              returned tensor (same shape as output or output.size(dim),
              if dim was specified) representing the number of occurrences
              for each unique value or tensor.

    Example::

        >>> output = torch.unique(torch.tensor([1, 3, 2, 3], dtype=torch.long))
        >>> output
        tensor([1, 2, 3])

        >>> output, inverse_indices = torch.unique(
        ...     torch.tensor([1, 3, 2, 3], dtype=torch.long), sorted=True, return_inverse=True)
        >>> output
        tensor([1, 2, 3])
        >>> inverse_indices
        tensor([0, 2, 1, 2])

        >>> output, inverse_indices = torch.unique(
        ...     torch.tensor([[1, 3], [2, 3]], dtype=torch.long), sorted=True, return_inverse=True)
        >>> output
        tensor([1, 2, 3])
        >>> inverse_indices
        tensor([[0, 2],
                [1, 2]])

        >>> a = torch.tensor([

        ...         [0, 0, 1, 1],
        ...     ],
        ... ])

        >>> # If we call `torch.unique(a, dim=0)`, each of the tensors `a[idx, :, :]`
        >>> # will be compared. We can see that `a[0, :, :]` and `a[2, :, :]` match

    ]

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly specified for the API to function correctly.  
    - "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": Pairs of parameters that cannot be used together in a single call due to logical or operational conflicts.  
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" refer to parameter pairs that are not universally mutually exclusive but become incompatible only under specific conditions. In these cases, the mutual exclusion depends on certain value combinations, e.g., the parameters conflict only when both assume particular values or satisfy certain conditions based on their assigned values. Thus, these are a subset of "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" that exhibit conditional, rather than absolute, exclusivity.
    - "Mandatory coexistence parameters": Sets of parameters that must be provided together to ensure valid configuration or meaningful behavior.
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters": When the parameters meet certain conditions, it will prevent the function from running.

    ---
    3. Your Tasks:

    Based on the documentation and definitions provided:

    1. Determine the Type of Each Parameter.
    For each explicitly defined parameter in [fun_string], determine its type, such as: tensor, int, str, optional tensor, etc.
    2. Identify Parameter Dependency Structures as accurately and completely as possible:
    - List all "Mandatory Parameters"  
    - Identify any "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs"  
    - Identify any "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" 
    - Identify any "Mandatory Coexistence Parameters"

    ---
    4.Output Format:
    
    {
    "Parameter type": {
        "input": "...",
        "weight": "...",
        "bias": "...",
        "stride": "...",
        "padding": "...",

    },
    "Parameter dependencies": {
        "Mandatory Parameters": ["input"],
        "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": [["return_inverse", "return_counts"]],
        "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": [],
        "Mandatory Coexistence Parameters": []
    }
    }

    Note: The output should be in JSON format, but in this case, since it's a text response, we'll format it as a dictionary with proper syntax.

    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.stft]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [Short-time Fourier transform (STFT).

    .. warning::
        From version 1.8.0, :attr:`return_complex` must always be given
        explicitly for real inputs and `return_complex=False` has been
        deprecated. Strongly prefer `return_complex=True` as in a future
        pytorch release, this function will only return complex tensors.

        Note that :func:`torch.view_as_real` can be used to recover a real
        tensor with an extra last dimension for real and imaginary components.

    .. warning::
        From version 2.1, a warning will be provided if a :attr:`window` is
        not specified. In a future release, this attribute will be required.
        Not providing a window currently defaults to using a rectangular window,
        which may result in undesirable artifacts. Consider using tapered windows,
        such as :func:`torch.hann_window`.

    The STFT computes the Fourier transform of short overlapping windows of the
    input. This giving frequency components of the signal as they change over
    time. The interface of this function is modeled after (but *not* a drop-in
    replacement for) librosa_ stft function.

    .. _librosa: https://librosa.org/doc/latest/generated/librosa.stft.html

    Ignoring the optional batch dimension, this method computes the following
    expression:

    .. math::
        X[\omega, m] = \sum_{k = 0}^{\text{win\_length-1}}%
                            \text{window}[k]\ \text{input}[m \times \text{hop\_length} + k]\ %
                            \exp\left(- j \frac{2 \pi \cdot \omega k}{\text{n\_fft}}\right),

    where :math:`m` is the index of the sliding window, and :math:`\omega` is
    the frequency :math:`0 \leq \omega < \text{n\_fft}` for ``onesided=False``,
    or :math:`0 \leq \omega < \lfloor \text{n\_fft} / 2 \rfloor + 1` for ``onesided=True``.

    * :attr:`input` must be either a 1-D time sequence or a 2-D batch of time
      sequences.

    * If :attr:`hop_length` is ``None`` (default), it is treated as equal to
      ``floor(n_fft / 4)``.

    * If :attr:`win_length` is ``None`` (default), it is treated as equal to
      :attr:`n_fft`.

    * :attr:`window` can be a 1-D tensor of size :attr:`win_length`, e.g., from
      :meth:`torch.hann_window`. If :attr:`window` is ``None`` (default), it is
      treated as if having :math:`1` everywhere in the window. If
      :math:`\text{win\_length} < \text{n\_fft}`, :attr:`window` will be padded on
      both sides to length :attr:`n_fft` before being applied.

    * If :attr:`center` is ``True`` (default), :attr:`input` will be padded on
      both sides so that the :math:`t`-th frame is centered at time
      :math:`t \times \text{hop\_length}`. Otherwise, the :math:`t`-th frame
      begins at time  :math:`t \times \text{hop\_length}`.

    * :attr:`pad_mode` determines the padding method used on :attr:`input` when
      :attr:`center` is ``True``. See :meth:`torch.nn.functional.pad` for
      all available options. Default is ``"reflect"``.

    * If :attr:`onesided` is ``True`` (default for real input), only values for
      :math:`\omega` in :math:`\left[0, 1, 2, \dots, \left\lfloor
      \frac{\text{n\_fft}}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\right]` are returned because
      the real-to-complex Fourier transform satisfies the conjugate symmetry,
      i.e., :math:`X[m, \omega] = X[m, \text{n\_fft} - \omega]^*`.
      Note if the input or window tensors are complex, then :attr:`onesided`
      output is not possible.

    * If :attr:`normalized` is ``True`` (default is ``False``), the function
      returns the normalized STFT results, i.e., multiplied by :math:`(\text{frame\_length})^{-0.5}`.

    * If :attr:`return_complex` is ``True`` (default if input is complex), the
      return is a ``input.dim() + 1`` dimensional complex tensor. If ``False``,
      the output is a ``input.dim() + 2`` dimensional real tensor where the last
      dimension represents the real and imaginary components.

    Returns either a complex tensor of size :math:`(* \times N \times T)` if
    :attr:`return_complex` is true, or a real tensor of size :math:`(* \times N
    \times T \times 2)`. Where :math:`*` is the optional batch size of
    :attr:`input`, :math:`N` is the number of frequencies where STFT is applied
    and :math:`T` is the total number of frames used.

    .. warning::
      This function changed signature at version 0.4.1. Calling with the
      previous signature may cause error or return incorrect result.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): the input tensor of shape `(B?, L)` where `B?` is an optional
            batch dimension
        n_fft (int): size of Fourier transform
        hop_length (int, optional): the distance between neighboring sliding window
            frames. Default: ``None`` (treated as equal to ``floor(n_fft / 4)``)
        win_length (int, optional): the size of window frame and STFT filter.
            Default: ``None``  (treated as equal to :attr:`n_fft`)
        window (Tensor, optional): the optional window function.
            Shape must be 1d and `<= n_fft`
            Default: ``None`` (treated as window of all :math:`1` s)
        center (bool, optional): whether to pad :attr:`input` on both sides so
            that the :math:`t`-th frame is centered at time :math:`t \times \text{hop\_length}`.
            Default: ``True``
        pad_mode (str, optional): controls the padding method used when
            :attr:`center` is ``True``. Default: ``"reflect"``
        normalized (bool, optional): controls whether to return the normalized STFT results
             Default: ``False``
        onesided (bool, optional): controls whether to return half of results to
            avoid redundancy for real inputs.
            Default: ``True`` for real :attr:`input` and :attr:`window`, ``False`` otherwise.
        return_complex (bool, optional): whether to return a complex tensor, or
            a real tensor with an extra last dimension for the real and
            imaginary components.

            .. versionchanged:: 2.0
               ``return_complex`` is now a required argument for real inputs,
               as the default is being transitioned to ``True``.

            .. deprecated:: 2.0
               ``return_complex=False`` is deprecated, instead use ``return_complex=True``
               Note that calling :func:`torch.view_as_real` on the output will
               recover the deprecated output format.

    Returns:
        Tensor: A tensor containing the STFT result with shape `(B?, N, T, C?)` where
           - `B?` is an optional batch dimension from the input.
           - `N` is the number of frequency samples, `(n_fft // 2) + 1` for
             `onesided=True`, or otherwise `n_fft`.
           - `T` is the number of frames, `1 + L // hop_length`
             for `center=True`, or `1 + (L - n_fft) // hop_length` otherwise.
           - `C?` is an optional length-2 dimension of real and imaginary
             components, present when `return_complex=False`.

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly specified for the API to function correctly.  
    - "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": Pairs of parameters that cannot be used together in a single call.  
    - "Conditional Parameters": Parameters whose presence or absence depends on the value of another parameter.

    The task is to analyze the [torch.stft] API and identify all such interdependencies among its parameters.

    ---
    3. Task:

    Based on the provided documentation, identify and describe all the parameter interdependencies in the [torch.stft] API, categorizing them into the three types mentioned above.

    The output should be a structured list, with each entry specifying the type of interdependency, the parameters involved, and a brief explanation of the dependency.

    The output should be in English.

    ---
    4. Output Format:

    The output should be a list of dictionaries, each with the following keys:
    - "Type": The type of interdependency (Mandatory, Mutual Exclusion, Conditional).
    - "Parameters": A list of parameter names involved in the interdependency.
    - "Explanation": A brief explanation of the dependency.

    The output should be in JSON format.

    ---
    5. Example:

    For example, if the API has a parameter 'a' that is mandatory, and parameters 'b' and 'c' that are mutually exclusive, the output would be:

    [
        {
            "Type": "Mandatory",
            "Parameters": ["a"],
            "Explanation": "Parameter 'a' must be explicitly specified."
        },
        {
            "Type": "Mutual Exclusion",
            "Parameters": ["b", "c"],
            "Explanation": "Parameters 'b' and 'c' cannot be used together."
        }
    ]

    ---
    6. Constraints:

    - The output must be in JSON format.
    - Each entry must have exactly the three keys: "Type", "Parameters", and "Explanation".
    - The "Parameters" key must be a list of strings, each being a parameter name.
    - The "Explanation" must be a concise, clear English sentence.
    - The output must be properly formatted with correct syntax, including commas and brackets.
    - The output must not include any markdown formatting or other non-JSON content.
    - The output must be enclosed within triple backticks (```), but the content inside must be valid JSON.

    ---
    7. Additional Notes:

    - Consider all parameters listed in the API documentation.
    - Ensure that all interdependencies are captured, including those implied by the documentation but not explicitly stated.
    - Be precise in identifying the exact parameters involved in each interdependency.
    - Avoid including interdependencies that are not supported by the documentation.
    - Ensure that the output is accurate and comprehensive.

    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.einsum]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [einsum(equation, *operands) -> Tensor

    Sums the product of the elements of the input :attr:`operands` along dimensions specified using a notation
    based on the Einstein summation convention.

    Einsum allows computing many common multi-dimensional linear algebraic array operations by representing them
    in a short-hand format based on the Einstein summation convention, given by :attr:`equation`. The details of
    this format are described below, but the general idea is to label every dimension of the input :attr:`operands`
    with some subscript and define which subscripts are part of the output. The output is then computed by summing
    the product of the elements of the :attr:`operands` along the dimensions whose subscripts are not part of the
    output. For example, matrix multiplication can be computed using einsum as `torch.einsum("ij,jk->ik", A, B)`.
    Here, j is the summation subscript and i and k the output subscripts (see section below for more details on why).

    Equation:

        The :attr:`equation` string specifies the subscripts (letters in `[a-zA-Z]`) for each dimension of
        the input :attr:`operands` in the same order as the dimensions, separating subscripts for each operand by a
        comma (','), e.g. `'ij,jk'` specify subscripts for two 2D operands. The dimensions labeled with the same subscript
        must be broadcastable, that is, their size must either match or be `1`. The exception is if a subscript is
        repeated for the same input operand, in which case the dimensions labeled with this subscript for this operand
        must match in size and the operand will be replaced by its diagonal along these dimensions. The subscripts that
        appear exactly once in the :attr:`equation` will be part of the output, sorted in increasing alphabetical order.
        The output is computed by multiplying the input :attr:`operands` element-wise, with their dimensions aligned based
        on the subscripts, and then summing out the dimensions whose subscripts are not part of the output.

        Optionally, the output subscripts can be explicitly defined by adding an arrow ('->') at the end of the equation
        followed by the subscripts for the output. For instance, the following equation computes the transpose of a
        matrix multiplication: 'ij,jk->ki'. The output subscripts must appear at least once for some input operand and
        at most once for the output.

        Ellipsis ('...') can be used in place of subscripts to broadcast the dimensions covered by the ellipsis.
        Each input operand may contain at most one ellipsis which will cover the dimensions not covered by subscripts,
        e.g. for an input operand with 5 dimensions, the ellipsis in the equation `'ab...c'` cover the third and fourth
        dimensions. The ellipsis does not need to cover the same number of dimensions across the :attr:`operands` but the
        'shape' of the ellipsis (the size of the dimensions covered by them) must broadcast together. If the output is not
        explicitly defined with the arrow ('->') notation, the ellipsis will come first in the output (left-most dimensions),
        before the subscript labels that appear exactly once for the input operands. e.g. the following equation implements
        batch matrix multiplication `'...ij,...jk'`.

        A few final notes: the equation may contain whitespaces between the different elements (subscripts, ellipsis,
        arrow and comma) but something like `'. . .'` is not valid. An empty string `''` is valid for scalar operands.

    .. note::

        ``torch.einsum`` handles ellipsis ('...') differently from NumPy in that it allows dimensions
        covered by the ellipsis to be summed over, that is, ellipsis are not required to be part of the output.

    .. note::

        This function uses opt_einsum (https://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to speed up computation or to
        consume less memory by optimizing contraction order. This optimization occurs when there are at least three
        inputs, since the order does not matter otherwise. Note that finding _the_ optimal path is an NP-hard problem,
        thus, opt_einsum relies on different heuristics to achieve near-optimal results. If opt_einsum is not available,
        the default order is to contract from left to right.

        To bypass this default behavior, add the following line to disable the usage of opt_einsum and skip path
        calculation: `torch.backends.opt_einsum.enabled = False`

        To specify which strategy you'd like for opt_einsum to compute the contraction path, add the following line:
        `torch.backends.opt_einsum.strategy = 'auto'`. The default strategy is 'auto', and we also support 'greedy' and
        'optimal'. Disclaimer that the runtime of 'optimal' is factorial in the number of inputs! See more details in
        the opt_einsum documentation (https://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/stable/path_finding.html).

    .. note::

        As of PyTorch 1.10 :func:`torch.einsum` also supports the sublist format (see examples below). In this format,
        subscripts for each operand are specified by sublists, list of integers in the range [0, 52). These sublists
        follow their operands, and an extra sublist can appear at the end of the input to specify the output's
        subscripts., e.g. `torch.einsum(op1, sublist1, op2, sublist2, ..., [subslist_out])`. Python's `Ellipsis` object
        may be provided in a sublist to enable broadcasting as described in the Equation section above.

    Args:
        equation (str): The subscripts for the Einstein summation.
        operands (List[Tensor]): The tensors to compute the Einstein summation of.

    (2) Use Cases.

    The user is trying to compute a tensor contraction using einsum, but is encountering issues with the output shape.

    (3) Problem Statement.

    The user has two tensors, A and B, with shapes (2, 3, 4) and (3, 4, 5) respectively. They are trying to compute a contraction where the output should have shape (2, 5). However, when they use the equation 'ab,bc->ac', the output shape is (2, 3, 5) instead of the expected (2,5). The user is confused about why this is happening and how to correct the equation to get the desired output.

    (4) Goal.

    The goal is to explain why the current equation is producing the wrong output shape and provide the correct equation that will result in the desired output shape of (2,5).

    (5) Constraints.

    - The solution must use torch.einsum.
    - The solution must not change the input tensors' shapes.
    - The solution must be efficient and avoid unnecessary computations.
    - The solution must be explained in a way that is clear and educational for someone learning to use einsum.

    (6) Additional Information.

    - The user is using PyTorch version 1.10 or higher.
    - The user is familiar with basic tensor operations but is new to einsum.
    - The user has tried other equations but hasn't found the correct one yet.
</think>

To solve the problem, let's analyze the issue step by step.

**Understanding the Problem:**
The user has two tensors:
- Tensor A with shape (2, 3, 4)
- Tensor B with shape (3, 4, 5)

They want to compute a contraction using `torch.einsum` such that the output tensor has shape (2, 5).

**Current Equation and Issue:**
The user is using the equation `'ab,bc->ac'`. Let's break down what this equation does.

- **Tensor A (shape 2x3x4):** The subscripts are 'a', 'b', 'c'.
- **Tensor B (shape 3x4x5):** The subscripts are 'b', 'c', 'd'.

The equation `'ab,bc->ac'` implies:
- Sum over dimensions 'b' and 'c'.
- The output should have dimensions 'a' and 'd' (since 'd' is the remaining dimension in B after summing 'b' and 'c').

However, the output shape is (2, 3, 5) instead of (2, 5). This suggests that the current equation is not correctly contracting all the necessary dimensions.

**Why the Current Equation Fails:**
In the equation `'ab,bc->ac'`:
- 'a' is from A's first dimension (size 2).
- 'b' is the second dimension of A (size 3) and the first dimension of B (size 3) → these can be summed over.
- 'c' is the third dimension of A (size 4) and the second dimension of B (size 4) → these can also be summed over.
- 'd' is the third dimension of B (size 5), which becomes the second dimension of the output.

But wait, the output dimensions are 'a' and 'd', which should result in shape (2,5). However, the user is getting (2,3,5). This discrepancy suggests that the equation is not correctly handling all dimensions.

**Correcting the Equation:**
The issue arises because the current equation does not account for all dimensions correctly. Let's re-express the tensors with appropriate subscripts and determine the correct contraction.

Let's redefine the subscripts for clarity:
- Tensor A: shape (2, 3, 4) → subscripts 'i', 'j', 'k'
- Tensor B: shape (3, 4, 5) → subscripts 'j', 'k', 'l'

The goal is to sum over 'j' and 'k', resulting in an output with dimensions 'i' and 'l' (shape 2x5).

**Correct Equation:**
The correct equation should be `'ijk,jkl->il'`.

Breaking it down:
- 'i' (from A) and 'l' (from B) are the output dimensions.
- 'j' and 'k' are summed over.

**Verification:**
- A has dimensions 'i', 'j', 'k' →

    [
triu(input, diagonal=0, *, out=None) -> Tensor

Returns the upper triangular part of a matrix (2-D tensor) or batch of matrices
:attr:`input`, the other elements of the result tensor :attr:`out` are set to 0.

The upper triangular part of the matrix is defined as the elements on and
above the diagonal.

The argument :attr:`diagonal` controls which diagonal to consider. If
:attr:`diagonal` = 0, all elements on and above the main diagonal are
retained. A positive value excludes just as many diagonals above the main
diagonal, and similarly a negative value includes just as many diagonals below
the main diagonal. The main diagonal are the set of indices
:math:`\lbrace (i, i) \rbrace` for :math:`i \in [0, \min\{d_{1}, d_{2}\} - 1]` where
:math:`d_{1}, d_{2}` are the dimensions of the matrix.

Args:

]

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly specified for the API to function correctly.  
    - "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": Pairs of parameters that cannot be used together in a single call due to logical or operational conflicts.  
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" refer to parameter pairs that are not universally mutually exclusive but become incompatible only under specific conditions. In these cases, the mutual exclusion depends on certain value combinations, e.g., the parameters conflict only when both assume particular values or satisfy certain conditions based on their assigned values. Thus, these are a subset of "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" that exhibit conditional, rather than absolute, exclusivity.
    - "Mandatory coexistence parameters": Sets of parameters that must be provided together to ensure valid configuration or meaningful behavior.
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters": When the parameters meet certain conditions, it will prevent the function from running.

    3. Your Tasks:

    Based on the documentation and definitions provided:

    1. Determine the Type of Each Parameter.
    For each explicitly defined parameter in [fun_string], determine its type, such as: tensor, int, str, optional tensor, etc.
    2. Identify Parameter Dependency Structures as accurately and completely as possible:
    - List all "Mandatory Parameters"  
    - Identify any "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs"  
    - Identify any "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" 
    - Identify any "Mandatory Coexistence Parameters"

    1. Role:
        You are an expert in [torch], with deep knowledge of its API design, functionality, and practical usage across a wide range of scenarios.

    ---
    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.svd]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [
svd(input, some=True, compute_uv=True, *, out=None) -> (Tensor, Tensor, Tensor)

Computes the singular value decomposition of either a matrix or batch of
matrices :attr:`input`. The singular value decomposition is represented as a
namedtuple `(U, S, V)`, such that :attr:`input` :math:`= U \text{diag}(S) V^{\text{H}}`.
where :math:`V^{\text{H}}` is the transpose of `V` for real inputs,
and the conjugate transpose of `V` for complex inputs.
If :attr:`input` is a batch of matrices, then `U`, `S`, and `V` are also
batched with the same batch dimensions as :attr:`input`.

If :attr:`some` is `True` (default), the method returns the reduced singular
value decomposition. In this case, if the last two dimensions of :attr:`input` are
`m` and `n`, then the returned `U` and `V` matrices will contain only
`min(n, m)` orthonormal columns.

If :attr:`compute_uv` is `False`, the returned `U` and `V` will be
zero-filled matrices of shape `(m, m)` and `(n, n)`
respectively, and the same device as :attr:`input`. The argument :attr:`some`
has no effect when :attr:`compute_uv` is `False`.

Supports :attr:`input` of float, double, cfloat and cdouble data types.
The dtypes of `U` and `V` are the same as :attr:`input`'s. `S` will
always be real-valued, even if :attr:`input` is complex.

.. warning::

    :func:`torch.svd` is deprecated in favor of :func:`torch.linalg.svd`
    and will be removed in a future PyTorch release.

    ``U, S, V = torch.svd(A, some=some, compute_uv=True)`` (default) should be replaced with

    .. code:: python

        U, S, Vh = torch.linalg.svd(A, full_matrices=not some)
        V = Vh.mH

    ``_, S, _ = torch.svd(A, some=some, compute_uv=False)`` should be replaced with

    .. code:: python

        S = torch.linalg.svdvals(A)

.. note:: Differences with :func:`torch.linalg.svd`:

             * :attr:`some` is the opposite of
               :func:`torch.linalg.svd`'s :attr:`full_matrices`. Note that
               default value for both is `True`, so the default behavior is
               effectively the opposite.
             * :func:`torch.svd` returns `V`, whereas :func:`torch.linalg.svd` returns
               `Vh`, that is, :math:`V^{\text{H}}`.
             * If :attr:`compute_uv` is `False`, :func:`torch.svd` returns zero-filled
               tensors for `U` and `Vh`, whereas :func:`torch.linalg.svd` returns
               empty tensors.

.. note:: The singular values are returned in descending order. If :attr:`input` is a batch of matrices,
          then the singular values of each matrix in the batch are returned in descending order.

.. note:: The `S` tensor can only be used to compute gradients if :attr:`compute_uv` is `True`.

.. note:: When :attr:`some` is `False`, the gradients on `U[..., :, min(m, n):]`
          and `V[..., :, min(m, n):]` will be ignored in the backward pass, as those vectors
          can be arbitrary bases of the corresponding subspaces.

.. note:: The implementation of :func:`torch.linalg.svd` on CPU uses LAPACK's routine `?gesdd`
          (a divide-and-conquer algorithm) instead of `?gesvd` for speed. Analogously,
          on GPU, it uses cuSOLVER's routines `gesvdj` and `gesvdjBatched` on CUDA 10.1.243
          and later, and MAGMA's routine `gesdd` on earlier versions of CUDA.

.. note:: The returned `U` will not be contiguous. The matrix (or batch of matrices) will
          be represented as a column-major matrix (i.e. Fortran-contiguous).

.. warning:: The gradients with respect to `U` and `V` will only be finite when the input does not
             have zero nor repeated singular values.

.. warning:: If the distance between any two singular values is close to zero, the gradients with respect to
             `U` and `V` will be numerically unstable, as they depends on
             :math:`\frac{1}{\min_{i \neq j} \sigma_i^2 - \sigma_j^2}`. The same happens when the matrix
             has small singular values, as these gradients also depend on `S^{-1}`.

.. warning:: For complex-valued :attr:`input` the singular value decomposition is not unique,
             as `U` and `V` may be multiplied by an arbitrary phase factor :math:`e^{i \phi}` on every column.
             The same happens when :attr:`input` has repeated singular values, where one may multiply
             the columns of the spanning subspace in `U` and `V` by a rotation matrix
             and `the resulting vectors will span the same subspace`_.
             Different platforms, like NumPy, or inputs on different device types,
             may produce different `U` and `V` tensors.

Args:
    input (Tensor): the input tensor of size `(*, m, n)` where `*` is zero or more
                    batch dimensions consisting of `(m, n)` matrices.
    some (bool, optional): controls whether to compute the reduced or full decomposition, and
                           consequently, the shape of returned `U` and `V`. Default: `True`.
    compute_uv (bool, optional): controls whether to compute `U` and `V`. Default: `True`.

Keyword args:
    out (tuple, optional): the output tuple of tensors

    >>> a = torch.randn(5, 3)
    >>> a
    tensor([[ 0.2364, -0.7752,  0.6372],

            [ 0.4234,  0.2481, -0.4733]])
    >>> s
    tensor([2.3289, 2.0315, 0.7806])
    >>> v

            [-0.5080,  0.4054, -0.7600],
            [ 0.8611,  0.2594, -0.4373]])
    >>> torch.dist(a, torch.mm(torch.mm(u, torch.diag(s)), v.t()))
    tensor(8.6531e-07)
    >>> a_big = torch.randn(7, 5, 3)

    1. Role:
        You are an expert in [torch], with deep knowledge of its API design, functionality, and practical usage across a wide range of scenarios.

    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.lobpcg]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [Find the k largest (or smallest) eigenvalues and the corresponding
    eigenvectors of a symmetric positive definite generalized
    eigenvalue problem using matrix-free LOBPCG methods.

    This function is a front-end to the following LOBPCG algorithms
    selectable via `method` argument:

      `method="basic"` - the LOBPCG method introduced by Andrew
      Knyazev, see [Knyazev2001]. A less robust method, may fail when
      Cholesky is applied to singular input.

      `method="ortho"` - the LOBPCG method with orthogonal basis
      selection [StathopoulosEtal2002]. A robust method.

    Supported inputs are dense, sparse, and batches of dense matrices.

    .. note:: In general, the basic method spends least time per
      iteration. However, the robust methods converge much faster and
      are more stable. So, the usage of the basic method is generally
      not recommended but there exist cases where the usage of the
      basic method may be preferred.

    .. warning:: The backward method does not support sparse and complex inputs.
      It works only when `B` is not provided (i.e. `B == None`).
      We are actively working on extensions, and the details of
      the algorithms are going to be published promptly.

    .. warning:: While it is assumed that `A` is symmetric, `A.grad` is not.
      To make sure that `A.grad` is symmetric, so that `A - t * A.grad` is symmetric
      in first-order optimization routines, prior to running `lobpcg`
      we do the following symmetrization map: `A -> (A + A.t()) / 2`.
      The map is performed only when the `A` requires gradients.

    Args:

      A (Tensor): the input tensor of size :math:`(*, m, m)`

      B (Tensor, optional): the input tensor of size :math:`(*, m,
                  m)`. When not specified, `B` is interpreted as
                  identity matrix.

      X (tensor, optional): the input tensor of size :math:`(*, m, n)`
                  where `k <= n <= m`. When specified, it is used as
                  initial approximation of eigenvectors. X must be a
                  dense tensor.

      iK (tensor, optional): the input tensor of size :math:`(*, m,
                  m)`. When specified, it will be used as preconditioner.

      k (integer, optional): the number of requested
                  eigenpairs. Default is the number of :math:`X`
                  columns (when specified) or `1`.

      n (integer, optional): if :math:`X` is not specified then `n`
                  specifies the size of the generated random
                  approximation of eigenvectors. Default value for `n`
                  is `k`. If :math:`X` is specified, the value of `n`
                  (when specified) must be the number of :math:`X`
                  columns.

      tol (float, optional): residual tolerance for stopping
                 criterion. Default is `feps ** 0.5` where `feps` is
                 smallest non-zero floating-point number of the given
                 input tensor `A` data type.

      largest (bool, optional): when True, solve the eigenproblem for
                 the largest eigenvalues. Otherwise, solve the
                 eigenproblem for smallest eigenvalues. Default is
                 `True`.

      method (str, optional): select LOBPCG method. See the
                 description of the function above. Default is
                 "ortho".

      niter (int, optional): maximum number of iterations. When
                 reached, the iteration process is hard-stopped and
                 the current approximation of eigenpairs is returned.
                 For infinite iteration but until convergence criteria
                 is met, use `-1`.

      tracker (callable, optional) : a function for tracing the
                 iteration process. When specified, it is called at
                 each iteration step with LOBPCG instance as an
                 argument. The LOBPCG instance holds the full state of
                 the iteration process in the following attributes:

                   `iparams`, `fparams`, `bparams` - dictionaries of
                   integer, float, and boolean valued input
                   parameters, respectively

                   `ivars`, `fvars`, `bvars`, `tvars` - dictionaries
                   of integer, float, boolean, and Tensor valued
                   iteration variables, respectively.

                   `A`, `B`, `iK` - input Tensor arguments.

                   `E`, `X`, `S`, `R` - iteration Tensor variables.

                 For instance:

                   `ivars["istep"]` - the current iteration step
                   `X` - the current approximation of eigenvectors
                   `E` - the current approximation of eigenvalues
                   `R` - the current residual
                   `ivars["converged_count"]` - the current number of converged eigenpairs
                   `tvars["rerr"]` - the current state of convergence criteria

                 Note that when `tracker` stores Tensor objects from
                 the LOBPCG instance, it must make copies of these.

                 If `tracker` sets `bvars["force_stop"] = True`, the
                 iteration process will be hard-stopped.

      ortho_iparams, ortho_fparams, ortho_bparams (dict, optional):
                 various parameters to LOBPCG algorithm when using
                 `method="ortho"`.

    Returns:

      E (Tensor): tensor of eigenvalues of size :math:`(*, k)`

      X (Tensor): tensor of eigenvectors of size :math:`(*, m, k)`

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly specified for the API to function correctly.  
    - "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": Pairs of parameters that cannot be used together in a single call due to logical or operational conflicts.  
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" refer to parameter pairs that are not universally mutually exclusive but become incompatible only under specific conditions. In these cases, the mutual exclusion depends on certain value combinations, e.g., the parameters conflict only when both assume particular values or satisfy certain conditions based on their assigned values. Thus, these are a subset of "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" that exhibit conditional, rather than absolute, exclusivity.
    - "Mandatory coexistence parameters": Sets of parameters that must be provided together to ensure valid configuration or meaningful behavior.
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters": When the parameters meet certain conditions, it will prevent the function from running.

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.use_deterministic_algorithms]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [Sets whether PyTorch operations must use "deterministic"
    algorithms. That is, algorithms which, given the same input, and when
    run on the same software and hardware, always produce the same output.
    When enabled, operations will use deterministic algorithms when available,
    and if only nondeterministic algorithms are available they will throw a
    :class:`RuntimeError` when called.

    .. note:: This setting alone is not always enough to make an application
        reproducible. Refer to :ref:`reproducibility` for more information.

    .. note:: :func:`torch.set_deterministic_debug_mode` offers an alternative

        * :class:`torch.nn.MaxUnpool2d`
        * :class:`torch.nn.MaxUnpool3d`
        * :func:`torch.nn.functional.interpolate` when attempting to differentiate a CUDA tensor
          and one of the following modes is used:

          - ``linear``
          - ``bilinear``
          - ``bicubic``

        * :func:`torch.Tensor.scatter_reduce` when ``reduce='prod'`` and called on CUDA tensor
        * :func:`torch.Tensor.resize_` when called with a quantized tensor

    In addition, several operations fill uninitialized memory when this setting
    is turned on and when
    :attr:`torch.utils.deterministic.fill_uninitialized_memory` is turned on.
    See the documentation for that attribute for more information.

    A handful of CUDA operations are nondeterministic if the CUDA version is
    10.2 or greater, unless the environment variable ``CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:4096:8``
    or ``CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:16:8`` is set. See the CUDA documentation for more
    details: `<https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cublas/index.html#results-reproducibility>`_
    If one of these environment variable configurations is not set, a :class:`RuntimeError`
    will be raised from these operations when called with CUDA tensors:

        * :func:`torch.mm`
        * :func:`torch.mv`
        * :func:`torch.bmm`

    Note that deterministic operations tend to have worse performance than
    nondeterministic operations.

    .. note::

        This flag does not detect or prevent nondeterministic behavior caused
        by calling an inplace operation on a tensor with an internal memory
        overlap or by giving such a tensor as the :attr:`out` argument for an
        operation. In these cases, multiple writes of different data may target
        a single memory location, and the order of writes is not guaranteed.

    Args:
        mode (:class:`bool`): If True, makes potentially nondeterministic
            operations switch to a deterministic algorithm or throw a runtime
            error. If False, allows nondeterministic operations.

    Keyword args:
        warn_only (:class:`bool`, optional): If True, operations that do not
            have a deterministic implementation will throw a warning instead of
            an error. Default: ``False``

    Example::

        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP
        >>> torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)

        # Forward mode nondeterministic error
        >>> torch.randn(10, device='cuda').kthvalue(1)
        ...
        RuntimeError: kthvalue CUDA does not have a deterministic implementation...

        # Backward mode nondeterministic error
        >>> torch.nn.AvgPool3d(1)(torch.randn(3, 4, 5, 6, requires_grad=True).cuda()).sum().backward()
        ...
        RuntimeError: avg_pool3d_backward_cuda does not have a deterministic implementation...
    ]

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly specified for the API to function correctly.  
    - "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": Pairs of parameters that cannot be used together in a single call due to logical or operational conflicts.  
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" refer to parameter pairs that are not universally mutually exclusive but become incompatible only under specific conditions. In these cases, the mutual exclusion depends on certain value combinations, e.g., the parameters conflict only when both assume particular values or satisfy certain conditions based on their assigned values. Thus, these are a subset of "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" that exhibit conditional, rather than absolute, exclusivity.

    (3) The Task.

    The task is to analyze the [torch.use_deterministic_algorithms] API and identify the types of parameter interdependencies it exhibits. Specifically, we need to determine whether the API has any "Mandatory Parameters", "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs", or "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs".

    The analysis should be based on the provided API documentation and any relevant knowledge about the API's usage and design.

    The output should be a structured report that clearly identifies each type of interdependency, providing specific examples where applicable.

    ---
    3. The Output.

    The output should be a structured report in markdown format, containing the following sections:

    - **Mandatory Parameters**: List of parameters that must be provided for the API to function correctly. If none, state that there are no mandatory parameters.
    - **Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs**: List of parameter pairs that cannot be used together. If none, state that there are no mutual exclusion pairs.
    - **Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs**: List of parameter pairs that are mutually exclusive only under certain conditions. If none, state that there are no conditional mutual exclusion pairs.

    Each section should provide a clear explanation and examples where applicable.

# Analysis of torch.use_deterministic_algorithms API Parameter Interdependencies

## Mandatory Parameters

The `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms` API has one mandatory parameter:

- **mode**: This boolean parameter determines whether deterministic algorithms are enforced. It must be explicitly set to either `True` or `False` for the API to function correctly. There are no default values provided for this parameter, making it mandatory.

## Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs

There are no mutual exclusion parameter pairs in this API. The API accepts only two parameters: `mode` and `warn_only`. These parameters do not conflict with each other and can be used together without issues.

## Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs

There are no conditional mutual exclusion parameter pairs in this API. The parameters `mode` and `warn_only` do not exhibit any conditional exclusivity. They can be used independently or together without any restrictions based on their values.

---

### Summary

- **Mandatory Parameters**: `mode`
- **Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs**: None
- **Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs**: None

This structured analysis provides a clear understanding of the parameter interdependencies within the `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms` API.

    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.Conv1d]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [Applies a 1D convolution over an input signal composed of several input
    planes.

    In the simplest case, the output value of the layer with input size
    :math:`(N, C_{\text{in}}, L)` and output :math:`(N, C_{\text{out}}, L_{\text{out}})` can be
    precisely described as:

    .. math::
        \text{out}(N_i, C_{\text{out}_j}) = \text{bias}(C_{\text{out}_j}) +
        \sum_{k = 0}^{C_{in} - 1} \text{weight}(C_{\text{out}_j}, k)
        \star \text{input}(N_i, k)

    where :math:`\star` is the valid `cross-correlation`_ operator,
    :math:`N` is a batch size, :math:`C` denotes a number of channels,
    :math:`L` is a length of signal sequence.
    

    This module supports :ref:`TensorFloat32<tf32_on_ampere>`.

    On certain ROCm devices, when using float16 inputs this module will use :ref:`different precision<fp16_on_mi200>` for backward.

    * :attr:`stride` controls the stride for the cross-correlation, a single
      number or a one-element tuple.

    * :attr:`padding` controls the amount of padding applied to the input. It
      can be either a string {'valid', 'same'} or a tuple of ints giving the
      amount of implicit padding applied on both sides.

    * :attr:`dilation` controls the spacing between the kernel points; also
      known as the à trous algorithm. It is harder to describe, but this `link`_
      has a nice visualization of what :attr:`dilation` does.

    * :attr:`groups` controls the connections between inputs and outputs.
      :attr:`in_channels` and :attr:`out_channels` must both be divisible by
      :attr:`groups`. For example,

        * At groups=1, all inputs are convolved to all outputs.
        * At groups=2, the operation becomes equivalent to having two conv
          layers side by side, each seeing half the input channels
          and producing half the output channels, and both subsequently
          concatenated.
        * At groups= :attr:`in_channels`, each input channel is convolved with
          its own set of filters (of size
          :math:`\frac{\text{out\_channels}}{\text{in\_channels}}`).

    Note:
        When `groups == in_channels` and `out_channels == K * in_channels`,
        where `K` is a positive integer, this operation is also known as a "depthwise convolution".

        In other words, for an input of size :math:`(N, C_{in}, L_{in})`,
        a depthwise convolution with a depthwise multiplier `K` can be performed with the arguments
        :math:`(C_\text{in}=C_\text{in}, C_\text{out}=C_\text{in} \times \text{K}, ..., \text{groups}=C_\text{in})`.
    Note:
        In some circumstances when given tensors on a CUDA device and using CuDNN, this operator may select a nondeterministic algorithm to increase performance. If this is undesirable, you can try to make the operation deterministic (potentially at a performance cost) by setting ``torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True``. See :doc:`/notes/randomness` for more information.

    Note:
        ``padding='valid'`` is the same as no padding. ``padding='same'`` pads
        the input so the output has the shape as the input. However, this mode
        doesn't support any stride values other than 1.

    Note:
        This module supports complex data types i.e. ``complex32, complex64, complex128``.

    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of channels in the input image
        out_channels (int): Number of channels produced by the convolution
        kernel_size (int or tuple): Size of the convolving kernel
        stride (int or tuple, optional): Stride of the convolution. Default: 1
        padding (int, tuple or str, optional): Padding added to both sides of
            the input. Default: 0
        dilation (int or tuple, optional): Spacing between kernel
            elements. Default: 1
        groups (int, optional): Number of blocked connections from input
            channels to output channels. Default: 1
        bias (bool, optional): If ``True``, adds a learnable bias to the
            output. Default: ``True``
        padding_mode (str, optional): ``'zeros'``, ``'reflect'``,
            ``'replicate'`` or ``'circular'``. Default: ``'zeros'``

    

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, C_{in}, L_{in})` or :math:`(C_{in}, L_{in})`
        - Output: :math:`(N, C_{out}, L_{out})` or :math:`(C_{out}, L_{out})`, where

          .. math::
              L_{out} = \left\lfloor\frac{L_{in} + 2 \times \text{padding} - \text{dilation}
                        \times (\text{kernel\_size} - 1) - 1}{\text{stride}} + 1\right\rfloor

    Attributes:
        weight (Tensor): the learnable weights of the module of shape
            :math:`(\text{out\_channels},
            \frac{\text{in\_channels}}{\text{groups}}, \text{kernel\_size})`.
            The values of these weights are sampled from
            :math:`\mathcal{U}(-\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{k})` where
            :math:`k = \frac{groups}{C_\text{in} * \text{kernel\_size}}`
        bias (Tensor):   the learnable bias of the module of shape
            (out_channels). If :attr:`bias` is ``True``, then the values of these weights are
            sampled from :math:`\mathcal{U}(-\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{k})` where
            :math:`k = \frac{groups}{C_\text{in} * \text{kernel\_size}}`

    Examples::

        >>> m = nn.Conv1d(16, 33, 3, stride=2)
        >>> input = torch.randn(20, 16, 50)
        >>> output = m(input)

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly specified for the API to function correctly.  
    - "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": Pairs of parameters that cannot be used together in a single call due to logical or operational conflicts.  
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" refer to parameter pairs that are not universally mutually exclusive but become incompatible only under specific conditions. In these cases, the mutual exclusion depends on certain value combinations, e.g., the parameters conflict only when both assume particular values or satisfy certain conditions based on their assigned values. Thus, these are a subset of "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" that exhibit conditional, rather than absolute, exclusivity.
    - "Mandatory coexistence parameters": Sets of parameters that must be provided together to ensure valid configuration or meaningful behavior.
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters": When the parameters meet certain conditions, it will prevent the function from running.

    ---
    3. Your Tasks:

    Based on the documentation and definitions provided:

    1. Determine the Type of Each Parameter.
    For each explicitly defined parameter in [fun_string], determine its type, such as: tensor, int, str, optional tensor, etc.
    2. Identify Parameter Dependency Structures as accurately and completely as possible:
    - List all "Mandatory Parameters"  
    - Identify any "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs"  
    - Identify any "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" 
    - Identify any "Mandatory Coexistence Parameters"

    ---
    4.Output Format:
    
    {
    "Parameter type": {
        "input": "...",
        "weight": "...",
        "bias": "...",
        ...
    },
    "Parameter dependencies": {
        "Mandatory Parameters": ["in_channels", "out_channels", ...],
        "Mutual Exclusion Pairs": [["padding", "padding_mode"], ...],
        "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Pairs": [["padding", "padding_mode"], ...],
        "Mandatory Coexistence Parameters": [["groups", "in_channels"], ...]
    }
    }

    Note: The output should be a JSON-like structure, but in markdown format.
    The keys in the "Parameter dependencies" should be exactly as specified.
    The values should be lists of parameter names or pairs as appropriate.
    If a dependency type is not present, it should be an empty list.
    The output should be in markdown format, but the structure should be clear.
    }

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.Conv2d]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [Applies a 2D convolution over an input signal composed of several input
    planes.

    In the simplest case, the output value of the layer with input size
    :math:`(N, C_{\text{in}}, H, W)` and output :math:`(N, C_{\text{out}}, H_{\text{out}}, W_{\text{out}})`

    .. math::
        \text{out}(N_i, C_{\text{out}_j}) = \text{bias}(C_{\text{out}_j}) +
        \sum_{k = 0}^{C_{\text{in}} - 1} \text{weight}(C_{\text{out}_j}, k) \star \text{input}(N_i, k)


    where :math:`\star` is the valid 2D `cross-correlation`_ operator,
    :math:`N` is a batch size, :math:`C` denotes a number of channels,
    :math:`H` is a height of input planes in pixels, and :math:`W` is
    width in pixels.
    

    This module supports :ref:`TensorFloat32<tf32_on_ampere>`.

    On certain ROCm devices, when using float16 inputs this module will use :ref:`different precision<fp16_on_mi200>` for backward.

    * :attr:`stride` controls the stride for the cross-correlation, a single
      number or a tuple.

    * :attr:`padding` controls the amount of padding applied to the input. It
      can be either a string {'valid', 'same'} or an int / a tuple of ints giving the
      amount of implicit padding applied on both sides.

    * :attr:`dilation` controls the spacing between the kernel points; also
      known as the à trous algorithm. It is harder to describe, but this `link`_
      has a nice visualization of what :attr:`dilation` does.


    * :attr:`groups` controls the connections between inputs and outputs.

          its own set of filters (of size
          :math:`\frac{\text{out\_channels}}{\text{in\_channels}}`).

    The parameters :attr:`kernel_size`, :attr:`stride`, :attr:`padding`, :attr:`dilation` can either be:

        - a single ``int`` -- in which case the same value is used for the height and width dimension
        - a ``tuple`` of two ints -- in which case, the first `int` is used for the height dimension,
          and the second `int` for the width dimension

    Note:
        When `groups == in_channels` and `out_channels == K * in_channels`,
        where `K` is a positive integer, this operation is also known as a "depthwise convolution".

    Note:
        In some circumstances when given tensors on a CUDA device and using CuDNN, this operator may select a nondeterministic algorithm to increase performance. If this is undesirable, you can try to make the operation deterministic (potentially at a performance cost) by setting ``torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True``. See :doc:`/notes/randomness` for more information.

    Note:
        ``padding='valid'`` is the same as no padding. ``padding='same'`` pads
        the input so the output has the shape as the input. However, this mode
        doesn't support any stride values other than 1.

    Note:
        This module supports complex data types i.e. ``complex32, complex64, complex128``.

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters. Each parameter can have different types of dependencies on other parameters. For example, some parameters may be optional, while others are required. Some parameters may have constraints based on the values of other parameters. These dependencies can be complex and are crucial for correct API usage.

    The task is to analyze the [torch.nn.Conv2d] API and identify all the parameter dependencies, including but not limited to:

    - Optional vs. required parameters.
    - Constraints on parameter values based on other parameters.
    - Default values and their implications.
    - Parameter interactions that affect the API's behavior.
    - Parameter combinations that are mutually exclusive or required together.
    - Parameter types and their allowed values.
    - Special cases or edge conditions where parameters behave differently.

    The analysis should be comprehensive, covering all parameters and their interdependencies.

    (3) Output Format.

    The output should be a detailed, structured analysis of the [torch.nn.Conv2d] API's parameter dependencies, presented in a clear and organized manner. The analysis should include:

    - A list of all parameters with their types and default values.
    - A description of each parameter's role and how it interacts with others.
    - Constraints and dependencies between parameters.
    - Special cases or edge conditions.
    - Examples of valid and invalid parameter combinations.
    - Any potential issues or pitfalls when using the API.

    The analysis should be thorough, ensuring that all aspects of parameter dependencies are covered.

    (4) Example of a Similar Analysis.

    For reference, here is an example of a similar analysis for another API:

    [Example Analysis for torch.nn.Linear]

    This example illustrates the structure and depth expected in the analysis.

    [The torch.nn.Linear API has the following parameters: in_features, out_features, bias. The in_features parameter is required, while out_features is also required. The bias parameter is optional with a default value of True. The in_features must be a positive integer, and out_features must also be a positive integer. The bias, if set to True, adds a learnable bias vector of size out_features. If set to False, no bias is added. There are no direct dependencies between in_features and out_features beyond their required positivity. However, the choice of out_features affects the dimensionality of the output tensor. The bias parameter does not interact directly with in_features or out_features but influences the model's ability to learn offsets in the output space. Special cases include when in_features is zero, which is not allowed, and when out_features is zero, which is also invalid. Examples of valid combinations include in_features=10, out_features=5, bias=True; invalid combinations include in_features=-3, out_features=5, bias=True.]

    This example shows how to structure the analysis, including parameter roles, dependencies, constraints, and examples.

    (5) Final Output.

    Based on the above, provide a comprehensive analysis of the [torch.nn.Conv2d] API's parameter dependencies, following the specified format and covering all aspects outlined in the task.

### Comprehensive Analysis of `torch.nn.Conv2d` API Parameter Dependencies

#### 1. Parameter List and Defaults

The `torch.nn.Conv2d` API accepts the following parameters:

- **in_channels (int)**: Required. Number of input channels.
- **out_channels (int)**: Required. Number of output channels.
- **kernel_size (int or tuple)**: Required. Size of the convolution kernel.
- **stride (int or tuple, optional)**: Default: 1. Stride of the convolution.
- **padding (int, tuple, or str, optional)**: Default: 0. Padding added to the input.
- **dilation (int or tuple, optional)**: Default: 1. Spacing between kernel elements.
- **groups (int, optional)**: Default: 1. Number of blocked connections.
- **bias (bool, optional)**: Default: True. Adds a learnable bias.
- **padding_mode (str, optional)**: Default: 'zeros'. Type of padding.

#### 2. Parameter Roles and Interactions

- **in_channels**: Determines the input dimensionality. Must be positive and compatible with `groups`.
- **out_channels**: Determines the output dimensionality. Must be positive and compatible with `groups`.
- **kernel_size**: Defines the size of the convolutional filter. Affects the output dimensions and the number of parameters.
- **stride**: Controls how the kernel moves over the input. Larger strides reduce output dimensions.
- **padding**: Adds zero (or other) values around the input to control output size. Can be 'valid' (no padding) or 'same' (output size matches input size when stride=1).
- **dilation**: Increases the kernel's field of view without increasing its size. Affects the effective kernel size.
- **groups**: Divides input and output channels into groups. Must divide both `in_channels` and `out_channels`.
- **bias**: Adds a bias term to the output. Does not interact with other parameters except affecting the output.
- **padding_mode**: Determines how padding is applied. Options include 'zeros', 'reflect', 'replicate', 'circular'.

#### 3. Constraints and Dependencies

- **in_channels and out_channels**:
  - Must be positive integers.
  - Must be divisible by `groups` if `groups > 1`.
  - When `groups = in_channels`, it implies a depthwise convolution, requiring `out_channels` to be a multiple of `in_channels`.

- **kernel_size**:
  - Must be a positive integer or a tuple of two positive integers.
  - Affects the output dimensions and the number of learnable parameters.

- **stride**:
  - Must be a positive integer or a tuple of two positive integers.
  - If `padding = 'same'`, `stride` must be 1.

- **padding**:
  - If a string, must be 'valid' or 'same'.
  - If an integer or tuple, must be non-negative.
  - When `padding = 'same'`, `stride` must be 1.

- **dilation**:
  - Must be a positive integer or a tuple of two positive integers.
  - Increases the effective kernel size, which can affect the output dimensions.

- **groups**:
  - Must be a positive integer.
  - Must divide both `in_channels` and `out_channels`.
  - When `groups = in_channels`, it enforces a depthwise convolution.

- **bias**:
  - A boolean that, if True, adds a bias term. No direct interaction with other parameters except affecting the output.

- **padding_mode**:
  - Must be one of 'zeros', 'reflect', 'replicate', 'circular'.
  - Only affects how padding is applied, not the core convolution operation.

#### 4. Special Cases and Edge Conditions

- **Depthwise Convolution**:
  - Occurs when `groups = in_channels` and `out_channels = K * in_channels`, where K is a positive integer.
  - Example: `in_channels=3`, `out_channels=6`, `groups=3` implies a depthwise convolution with a depthwise multiplier of 2.

- **Padding Modes**:
  - 'same' padding ensures the output size matches the input size when `stride=1`.
  - 'valid' padding results in no padding, which can reduce the output size.

- **Dilation**:
  - High dilation values can lead to very large effective kernel sizes, potentially causing vanishing gradients or computational inefficiency.

- **Groups**:
  - When `groups > 1`, the convolution is split into independent groups, reducing the number of connections between input and output channels.

#### 5. Examples of Valid and Invalid Parameter Combinations

**Valid Examples**:
1. `in_channels=3`, `out_channels=64`, `kernel_size=3`, `stride=1`, `padding=1`, `groups=1`, `bias=True`, `padding_mode='zeros'`.
2. `in_channels=16`, `out_channels=33`, `kernel_size=(3,5)`, `stride=(2,1)`, `padding=(4,2)`, `dilation=(3,1)`, `groups=1`, `bias=False`, `padding_mode='reflect'`.
3. Depthwise convolution: `in_channels=3`, `out_channels=6`, `kernel_size=3`, `groups=3`, `bias=True`.

**Invalid Examples**:
1. `in_channels=0` (invalid as it must be positive).
2. `out_channels=0` (invalid as it must be positive).
3. `groups=2` with `in_channels=3` (since 3 is not divisible by 2).
4. `padding='same'` with `stride=2` (invalid as 'same' padding requires stride=1).
5. `dilation=0` (invalid as dilation must be at least 1).

#### 6. Potential Issues and Pitfalls

- **Stride and Padding Interaction**:
  - Using `padding='same'` with a stride greater than 1 can lead to unexpected output sizes or errors.

- **Groups and Channels Compatibility**:
  - Ensuring that `in_channels` and `out_channels` are divisible by `groups` is crucial to avoid runtime errors.

- **Dilation and Kernel Size**:
  - High dilation values can significantly increase the effective kernel size, potentially leading to memory issues or vanishing gradients.

- **Padding Modes**:
  - Choosing the wrong padding mode can affect the output in ways that may not be intended, especially in tasks requiring precise spatial alignment.

- **Bias Parameter**:
  - While adding bias can improve model performance, it increases the number of learnable parameters, which

    1. Role:
        You are an expert in [torch], with deep knowledge of its API design, functionality, and practical usage across a wide range of scenarios.

    ---
    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.Conv3d]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [Applies a 3D convolution over an input signal composed of several input
    planes.

    In the simplest case, the output value of the layer with input size :math:`(N, C_{in}, D, H, W)`
    and output :math:`(N, C_{out}, D_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out})` can be precisely described as:

    .. math::
        out(N_i, C_{out_j}) = bias(C_{out_j}) +
                                \sum_{k = 0}^{C_{in} - 1} weight(C_{out_j}, k) \star input(N_i, k)

    where :math:`\star` is the valid 3D `cross-correlation`_ operator
    

    This module supports :ref:`TensorFloat32<tf32_on_ampere>`.

    On certain ROCm devices, when using float16 inputs this module will use :ref:`different precision<fp16_on_mi200>` for backward.

    * :attr:`stride` controls the stride for the cross-correlation.

    * :attr:`padding` controls the amount of padding applied to the input. It
      can be either a string {'valid', 'same'} or a tuple of ints giving the
      amount of implicit padding applied on both sides.

    * :attr:`dilation` controls the spacing between the kernel points; also known as the à trous algorithm.
      It is harder to describe, but this `link`_ has a nice visualization of what :attr:`dilation` does.


    * :attr:`groups` controls the connections between inputs and outputs.
      :attr:`in_channels` and :attr:`out_channels` must both be divisible by
      :attr:`groups`. For example,

        * At groups=1, all inputs are convolved to all outputs.
        * At groups=2, the operation becomes equivalent to having two conv
          layers side by side, each seeing half the input channels
          and producing half the output channels, and both subsequently
          concatenated.
        * At groups= :attr:`in_channels`, each input channel is convolved with
          its own set of filters (of size
          :math:`\frac{\text{out\_channels}}{\text{in\_channels}}`).

    The parameters :attr:`kernel_size`, :attr:`stride`, :attr:`padding`, :attr:`dilation` can either be:

        - a single ``int`` -- in which case the same value is used for the depth, height and width dimension
        - a ``tuple`` of three ints -- in which case, the first `int` is used for the depth dimension,
          the second `int` for the height dimension and the third `int` for the width dimension

    Note:
        When `groups == in_channels` and `out_channels == K * in_channels`,
        where `K` is a positive integer, this operation is also known as a "depthwise convolution".

        In other words, for an input of size :math:`(N, C_{in}, L_{in})`,
        a depthwise convolution with a depthwise multiplier `K` can be performed with the arguments
        :math:`(C_\text{in}=C_\text{in}, C_\text{out}=C_\text{in} \times \text{K}, ..., \text{groups}=C_\text{in})`.

    Note:
        In some circumstances when given tensors on a CUDA device and using CuDNN, this operator may select a nondeterministic algorithm to increase performance. If this is undesirable, you can try to make the operation deterministic (potentially at a performance cost) by setting ``torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True``. See :doc:`/notes/randomness` for more information.

    Note:
        ``padding='valid'`` is the same as no padding. ``padding='same'`` pads
        the input so the output has the shape as the input. However, this mode
        doesn't support any stride values other than 1.

    Note:
        This module supports complex data types i.e. ``complex32, complex64, complex128``.

    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of channels in the input image
        out_channels (int): Number of channels produced by the convolution
        kernel_size (int or tuple): Size of the convolving kernel
        stride (int or tuple, optional): Stride of the convolution. Default: 1
        padding (int, tuple or str, optional): Padding added to all six sides of
            the input. Default: 0
        dilation (int or tuple, optional): Spacing between kernel elements. Default: 1
        groups (int, optional): Number of blocked connections from input channels to output channels. Default: 1
        bias (bool, optional): If ``True``, adds a learnable bias to the output. Default: ``True``
        padding_mode (str, optional): ``'zeros'``, ``'reflect'``, ``'replicate'`` or ``'circular'``. Default: ``'zeros'``

        - Input: :math:`(N, C_{in}, D_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in})` or :math:`(C_{in}, D_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in})`
        - Output: :math:`(N, C_{out}, D_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out})` or :math:`(C_{out}, D_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out})`,
          where

              D_{out} = \left\lfloor\frac{D_{in} + 2 \times \text{padding}[0] - \text{dilation}[0]

                         The values of these weights are sampled from
                         :math:`\mathcal{U}(-\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{k})` where

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory": A parameter is mandatory if it must be provided by the user; otherwise, the API will throw an error or produce unexpected results.
    - "Optional": A parameter is optional if it can be omitted by the user, and the API will use a default value or infer it based on other parameters.
    - "Dependent": A parameter's validity or applicability depends on the value of another parameter. For example, certain parameters may only be relevant or allowed when another parameter is set to a specific value.

    The task is to analyze the [torch.nn.Conv3d] API and identify the dependency relationships among its parameters, categorizing each parameter into one of the above three types.

    (3) Parameter List.

    The parameters of the [torch.nn.Conv3d] API are as follows:

    - in_channels (int)
    - out_channels (int)
    - kernel_size (int or tuple)
    - stride (int or tuple, optional)
    - padding (int, tuple or str, optional)
    - dilation (int or tuple, optional)
    - groups (int, optional)
    - bias (bool, optional)
    - padding_mode (str, optional)

    (4) Parameter Descriptions.

    Each parameter's description is provided in the API documentation, which can be used to understand their roles and interdependencies.

    (5) Usage Examples.

    The API documentation includes usage examples, which can provide insights into how parameters are typically combined and used in practice.

    (6) Additional Notes.

    The API documentation also includes additional notes that may describe constraints, interactions, or special cases that affect parameter dependencies.

    ---
    3. Task:

    Analyze the [torch.nn.Conv3d] API and determine the dependency relationships among its parameters. For each parameter, classify it as "Mandatory", "Optional", or "Dependent" based on the provided documentation and any inferred relationships.

    The output should be a structured list where each entry corresponds to a parameter, specifying its type and any dependencies.

    Additionally, provide a brief explanation of the reasoning behind each classification.

    ---
    4. Output Format:

    The output should be a list of dictionaries, each with the following keys:
    - Parameter
    - Type
    - Dependencies (if any)
    - Explanation

    For example:

    [
        {
            "Parameter": "in_channels",
            "Type": "Mandatory",
            "Dependencies": [],
            "Explanation": "This parameter is mandatory because it specifies the number of input channels, which is essential for defining the convolution operation."
        },
        ...
    ]

    ---
    5. Constraints:

    - The analysis must be based solely on the provided documentation and any logical inferences that can be made from it.
    - Each parameter must be classified into exactly one of the three types.
    - Dependencies must be explicitly stated if they exist.
    - The explanation must clearly justify the classification and any dependencies.
    - The output must be in the specified format.

        You are an expert in [torch], with deep knowledge of its API design, functionality, and practical usage across a wide range of scenarios.

    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [Applies a 2D transposed convolution operator over an input image
    composed of several input planes.

    This module can be seen as the gradient of Conv2d with respect to its input.
    It is also known as a fractionally-strided convolution or
    a deconvolution (although it is not an actual deconvolution operation as it does
    not compute a true inverse of convolution). For more information, see the visualizations
    `here`_ and the `Deconvolutional Networks`_ paper.

    This module supports :ref:`TensorFloat32<tf32_on_ampere>`.

    On certain ROCm devices, when using float16 inputs this module will use :ref:`different precision<fp16_on_mi200>` for backward.

    * :attr:`stride` controls the stride for the cross-correlation.

    * :attr:`padding` controls the amount of implicit zero padding on both
      sides for ``dilation * (kernel_size - 1) - padding`` number of points. See note
      below for details.

    * :attr:`output_padding` controls the additional size added to one side
      of the output shape. See note below for details.

    * :attr:`dilation` controls the spacing between the kernel points; also known as the à trous algorithm.
      It is harder to describe, but the link `here`_ has a nice visualization of what :attr:`dilation` does.

    * :attr:`groups` controls the connections between inputs and outputs.
      :attr:`in_channels` and :attr:`out_channels` must both be divisible by
      :attr:`groups`. For example,

        * At groups=1, all inputs are convolved to all outputs.
        * At groups=2, the operation becomes equivalent to having two conv
          layers side by side, each seeing half the input channels
          and producing half the output channels, and both subsequently
          concatenated.
        * At groups= :attr:`in_channels`, each input channel is convolved with
          its own set of filters (of size
          :math:`\frac{\text{out\_channels}}{\text{in\_channels}}`).

    The parameters :attr:`kernel_size`, :attr:`stride`, :attr:`padding`, :attr:`output_padding`
    can either be:

        - a single ``int`` -- in which case the same value is used for the height and width dimensions
        - a ``tuple`` of two ints -- in which case, the first `int` is used for the height dimension,
          and the second `int` for the width dimension

    Note:
        The :attr:`padding` argument effectively adds ``dilation * (kernel_size - 1) - padding``
        amount of zero padding to both sizes of the input. This is set so that
        when a :class:`~torch.nn.Conv2d` and a :class:`~torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d`
        are initialized with same parameters, they are inverses of each other in
        regard to the input and output shapes. However, when ``stride > 1``,
        :class:`~torch.nn.Conv2d` maps multiple input shapes to the same output
        shape. :attr:`output_padding` is provided to resolve this ambiguity by
        effectively increasing the calculated output shape on one side. Note
        that :attr:`output_padding` is only used to find output shape, but does
        not actually add zero-padding to output.

    Note:
        In some circumstances when given tensors on a CUDA device and using CuDNN, this operator may select a nondeterministic algorithm to increase performance. If this is undesirable, you can try to make the operation deterministic (potentially at a performance cost) by setting ``torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True``. See :doc:`/notes/randomness` for more information.

    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of channels in the input image
        out_channels (int): Number of channels produced by the convolution

        stride (int or tuple, optional): Stride of the convolution. Default: 1
        padding (int or tuple, optional): ``dilation * (kernel_size - 1) - padding`` zero-padding
            will be added to both sides of each dimension in the input. Default: 0
        output_padding (int or tuple, optional): Additional size added to one side
            of each dimension in the output shape. Default: 0
        groups (int, optional): Number of blocked connections from input channels to output channels. Default: 1
        bias (bool, optional): If ``True``, adds a learnable bias to the output. Default: ``True``
        dilation (int or tuple, optional): Spacing between kernel elements. Default: 1

                        \times (\text{kernel\_size}[1] - 1) + \text{output\_padding}[1] + 1

    Attributes:
        weight (Tensor): the learnable weights of the module of shape
                         :math:`(\text{in\_channels}, \frac{\text{out\_channels}}{\text{groups}},`
                         :math:`\text{kernel\_size[0]}, \text{kernel\_size[1]})`.
                         The values of these weights are sampled from
                         :math:`\mathcal{U}(-\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{k})` where
                         :math:`k = \frac{groups}{C_\text{out} * \prod_{i=0}^{1}\text{kernel\_size}[i]}`
        bias (Tensor):   the learnable bias of the module of shape (out_channels)
                         If :attr:`bias` is ``True``, then the values of these weights are
                         sampled from :math:`\mathcal{U}(-\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{k})` where
                         :math:`k = \frac{groups}{C_\text{out} * \prod_{i=0}^{1}\text{kernel\_size}[i]}`

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly provided by the user for the API to function correctly. These are typically required for the API to perform its intended operation.

    - "Optional Parameters": Parameters that are not required for the API to function but can be specified to customize behavior. These often have default values that are suitable for common use cases.

    - "Dependent Parameters": Parameters whose validity or applicability depends on the values or presence of other parameters. For example, certain parameters may only be relevant when another parameter is set to a specific value.

    (3) Usage Patterns.

    The usage patterns refer to the different ways in which the API can be invoked, considering the various parameter combinations. Each usage pattern corresponds to a specific scenario or application, such as image processing, feature extraction, etc.

    (4) Best Practices.

    Best practices encompass the recommended ways to use the API effectively, considering performance, correctness, and maintainability. These may include parameter selection, initialization strategies, and usage scenarios where the API is particularly advantageous.

    (5) Common Pitfalls.

    Common pitfalls are the typical mistakes or misunderstandings users might encounter when using the API. These could include incorrect parameter settings, misunderstanding of parameter interactions, or misinterpretation of the API's behavior.

    Performance considerations involve how different parameter choices affect the computational efficiency, memory usage, and scalability of the API. This includes understanding how parameters like kernel size, stride, padding, and groups influence the computation.

    (7) Practical Examples.

    Practical examples provide concrete demonstrations of how to use the API in real-world scenarios. These examples should illustrate different usage patterns, best practices, and how to avoid common pitfalls.

    (8) API Design Rationale.

    The API design rationale explains the reasoning behind the API's structure, parameter choices, and default values. This includes considerations for usability, flexibility, and alignment with common deep learning practices.

    (9) Error Handling.

    Error handling refers to how the API manages invalid inputs or unexpected conditions. This includes the types of exceptions raised, validation of parameter values, and robustness against misuse.

    (10) Versioning and Backward Compatibility.

    Versioning and backward compatibility discuss how the API evolves over time, ensuring that changes do not break existing code and maintaining compatibility with previous versions.

    (11) Testing and Validation.

    Testing and validation involve the strategies and methods used to ensure the correctness and reliability of the API. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and validation against known benchmarks.

    (12) Documentation and User Guides.

    Documentation and user guides provide comprehensive explanations of the API's functionality, usage, and best practices. They are essential for users to understand and effectively utilize the API.

    (3) The task is to analyze the [torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d] API based on the provided documentation and the 12 aspects listed above.

### 1. Parameter Dependency Types

#### Mandatory Parameters:
- `in_channels`: The number of input channels. This is mandatory as it defines the input dimensionality.
- `out_channels`: The number of output channels. This is mandatory as it defines the output dimensionality.
- `kernel_size`: The size of the transposed convolution kernel. This is mandatory as it determines the filter size.

#### Optional Parameters:
- `stride` (default: 1): Controls the stride for the cross-correlation.
- `padding` (default: 0): Controls the amount of implicit zero padding.
- `output_padding` (default: 0): Controls the additional size added to one side of the output shape.
- `groups` (default: 1): Controls the connections between inputs and outputs.
- `bias` (default: True): If True, adds a learnable bias to the output.
- `dilation` (default: 1): Controls the spacing between kernel elements.

#### Dependent Parameters:
- `output_padding` depends on `stride` and `padding`. It is only relevant when `stride > 1` to resolve ambiguities in output shape.
- `groups` depends on `in_channels` and `out_channels`, which must both be divisible by `groups`.
- `padding` and `dilation` interact to determine the effective padding applied.

### 2. Usage Patterns

#### Use Cases:
1. **Basic Transposed Convolution**: Using default parameters for a simple upsampling operation.
2. **Custom Stride and Padding**: Adjusting `stride` and `padding` for specific upsampling factors.
3. **Depthwise Separable Convolutions**: Using `groups` to create depthwise separable layers.
4. **Fractionally Strided Convolutions**: Using `stride` and `dilation` for upsampling with specific kernel arrangements.

#### Examples:
- Upsampling an image by a factor of 2 using `stride=2`.
- Using `output_padding` to ensure the output size matches the input size after downsampling and upsampling.

### 3. Best Practices

- **Parameter Selection**:
  - Choose `kernel_size` based on the desired upsampling factor and feature interaction.
  - Use `stride` to control the upsampling factor directly.
  - Set `padding` and `output_padding` to ensure the output size aligns with expectations.
  - Use `groups` for channel-wise operations to reduce computational complexity.

- **Initialization**:
  - Consider using `bias=False` when using batch normalization to avoid redundant parameters.

- **Performance**:
  - Larger `kernel_size` increases computation and memory usage.
  - Using `groups` can reduce the number of parameters and computations.

### 4. Common Pitfalls

- **Misunderstanding Output Size**:
  - Incorrectly setting `padding` and `output_padding` can lead to unexpected output dimensions.
  - Solution: Use the formula provided in the documentation to calculate the output size.

- **Stride and Dilation Interaction**:
  - Overlooking how `stride` and `dilation` affect the effective kernel size and output.
  - Solution: Understand the combined effect of these parameters on the transposed convolution.

- **Bias Usage**:
  - Adding bias when it's unnecessary (e.g., when followed by batch normalization) can lead to overfitting.
  - Solution: Set `bias=False` when using normalization layers.

### 5. Performance Considerations

- **Kernel Size**:
  - Larger kernels increase the number of operations and memory usage.
  - Use smaller kernels for faster computations.

- **Stride**:
  - Larger strides result in larger output sizes but can reduce computational load by skipping elements.

- **Groups**:
  - Using `groups` can significantly reduce the number of parameters and computations, especially in depthwise separable convolutions.

- **Dilation**:
  - Higher dilation increases the receptive field without increasing the number of parameters.

### 6. Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Basic Upsampling
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define the transposed convolution layer
upsample = nn.ConvTranspose2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=3, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1)

# Input tensor
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)

# Forward pass
output = upsample(x)
print(output.size())  # Output: torch.Size([1, 3, 64, 64])
```

#### Example 2: Using Output Padding
```python
# Define the transposed convolution layer with output_padding
upsample = nn.ConvTranspose2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=3, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1, output_padding=1)

# Input tensor
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 16, 16)

# Forward pass
output = upsample(x)
print(output.size())  # Output: torch.Size([1, 3, 33, 33])

        bias (Tensor):   the learnable bias of the module of shape (out_channels)
                         If :attr:`bias` is ``True``, then the values of these weights are
                         sampled from :math:`\mathcal{U}(-\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{k})` where

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be set in conjunction with each other. For example, if parameter A is set, parameter B must also be set, and vice versa.
    - "Mutually Exclusive Parameters": Parameters that cannot be set simultaneously. For instance, parameter A and parameter B cannot both be specified in the same API call.
    - "Conditional Parameters": Parameters that are only relevant or valid when another parameter is set to a specific value. For example, parameter C is only applicable if parameter D is set to True.

    The task is to analyze the [torch.nn.ConvTranspose3d] API and identify all such interdependencies among its parameters.

    ---
    3. Task:

    Based on the provided documentation, identify and describe all the parameter interdependencies in [torch.nn.ConvTranspose3d], categorizing them into the three types mentioned above.

    The output should be a structured list, with each entry specifying the type of interdependency, the involved parameters, and a brief explanation of the dependency.

    For example:

    - **Mandatory Parameters**: Parameters A and B must be set together.
    - **Mutually Exclusive Parameters**: Parameters C and D cannot be used together.
    - **Conditional Parameters**: Parameter E is only valid if Parameter F is set to True.

    The output should be in English.
</think>

Here is the structured list of parameter interdependencies for `torch.nn.ConvTranspose3d`:

### Mandatory Parameters:
1. **in_channels and out_channels**:
   - These parameters are mandatory and must be specified when initializing the module. They define the number of input and output channels, respectively.

### Conditional Parameters:
1. **kernel_size**:
   - This parameter is required unless the module is being initialized with pre-defined weights, which is not typical for `ConvTranspose3d`.

2. **groups**:
   - The value of `groups` affects the dimensions of the `weight` and `bias` tensors. Specifically, both `in_channels` and `out_channels` must be divisible by `groups`. If `groups` is set to a value other than 1, it imposes constraints on the divisibility of `in_channels` and `out_channels`.

3. **dilation**:
   - When `dilation` is set to a value greater than 1, it affects the effective kernel size and the padding calculation. This parameter is only relevant if the user intends to use dilated convolutions.

4. **output_padding**:
   - This parameter is only relevant when `stride` is greater than 1. It helps resolve ambiguities in the output shape when multiple input sizes could result in the same output size after a forward convolution.

### Mutually Exclusive Parameters:
1. **None**:
   - There are no parameters in `ConvTranspose3d` that are mutually exclusive. All parameters can be set independently, provided they satisfy the constraints imposed by their relationships.

### Summary:
- **Mandatory Parameters**: `in_channels` and `out_channels` must always be specified.
- **Conditional Parameters**: `kernel_size`, `groups`, `dilation`, and `output_padding` have dependencies based on other parameters or usage context.
- **Mutually Exclusive Parameters**: None exist in this API.

    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.Unfold]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [Extracts sliding local blocks from a batched input tensor.

    Consider a batched :attr:`input` tensor of shape :math:`(N, C, *)`,
    where :math:`N` is the batch dimension, :math:`C` is the channel dimension,
    and :math:`*` represent arbitrary spatial dimensions. This operation flattens
    each sliding :attr:`kernel_size`-sized block within the spatial dimensions
    of :attr:`input` into a column (i.e., last dimension) of a 3-D :attr:`output`
    tensor of shape :math:`(N, C \times \prod(\text{kernel\_size}), L)`, where
    :math:`C \times \prod(\text{kernel\_size})` is the total number of values
    within each block (a block has :math:`\prod(\text{kernel\_size})` spatial
    locations each containing a :math:`C`-channeled vector), and :math:`L` is
    the total number of such blocks:

    .. math::
        L = \prod_d \left\lfloor\frac{\text{spatial\_size}[d] + 2 \times \text{padding}[d] %
            - \text{dilation}[d] \times (\text{kernel\_size}[d] - 1) - 1}{\text{stride}[d]} + 1\right\rfloor,

    where :math:`\text{spatial\_size}` is formed by the spatial dimensions
    of :attr:`input` (:math:`*` above), and :math:`d` is over all spatial
    dimensions.

    Therefore, indexing :attr:`output` at the last dimension (column dimension)
    gives all values within a certain block.

    The :attr:`padding`, :attr:`stride` and :attr:`dilation` arguments specify
    how the sliding blocks are retrieved.

    * :attr:`stride` controls the stride for the sliding blocks.

    * :attr:`padding` controls the amount of implicit zero-paddings on both
      sides for :attr:`padding` number of points for each dimension before
      reshaping.

    * :attr:`dilation` controls the spacing between the kernel points; also known as the à trous algorithm.
      It is harder to describe, but this `link`_ has a nice visualization of what :attr:`dilation` does.

    Args:
        kernel_size (int or tuple): the size of the sliding blocks
        dilation (int or tuple, optional): a parameter that controls the
                                           stride of elements within the
                                           neighborhood. Default: 1
        padding (int or tuple, optional): implicit zero padding to be added on
                                          both sides of input. Default: 0
        stride (int or tuple, optional): the stride of the sliding blocks in the input
                                         spatial dimensions. Default: 1

    * If :attr:`kernel_size`, :attr:`dilation`, :attr:`padding` or
      :attr:`stride` is an int or a tuple of length 1, their values will be
      replicated across all spatial dimensions.

    * For the case of two input spatial dimensions this operation is sometimes
      called ``im2col``.

    .. note::
        :class:`~torch.nn.Fold` calculates each combined value in the resulting
        large tensor by summing all values from all containing blocks.
        :class:`~torch.nn.Unfold` extracts the values in the local blocks by
        copying from the large tensor. So, if the blocks overlap, they are not
        inverses of each other.

        In general, folding and unfolding operations are related as
        follows. Consider :class:`~torch.nn.Fold` and
        :class:`~torch.nn.Unfold` instances created with the same
        parameters:

        >>> fold_params = dict(kernel_size=..., dilation=..., padding=..., stride=...)
        >>> fold = nn.Fold(output_size=..., **fold_params)
        >>> unfold = nn.Unfold(**fold_params)

        Then for any (supported) ``input`` tensor the following
        equality holds:

        ::

            fold(unfold(input)) == divisor * input

        where ``divisor`` is a tensor that depends only on the shape
        and dtype of the ``input``:

        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP
        >>> input_ones = torch.ones(input.shape, dtype=input.dtype)
        >>> divisor = fold(unfold(input_ones))

        When the ``divisor`` tensor contains no zero elements, then
        ``fold`` and ``unfold`` operations are inverses of each
        other (up to constant divisor).

    .. warning::
        Currently, only 4-D input tensors (batched image-like tensors) are
        supported.

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, C, *)`
        - Output: :math:`(N, C \times \prod(\text{kernel\_size}), L)` as described above

    Examples::

        >>> unfold = nn.Unfold(kernel_size=(2, 3))
        >>> input = torch.randn(2, 5, 3, 4)
        >>> output = unfold(input)
        >>> # each patch contains 30 values (2x3=6 vectors, each of 5 channels)
        >>> # 4 blocks (2x3 kernels) in total in the 3x4 input
        >>> output.size()
        torch.Size([2, 30, 4])

        >>> # xdoctest: +IGNORE_WANT
        >>> # Convolution is equivalent with Unfold + Matrix Multiplication + Fold (or view to output shape)
        >>> inp = torch.randn(1, 3, 10, 12)
        >>> w = torch.randn(2, 3, 4, 5)
        >>> inp_unf = torch.nn.functional.unfold(inp, (4, 5))
        >>> out_unf = inp_unf.transpose(1, 2).matmul(w.view(w.size(0), -1).t()).transpose(1, 2)
        >>> out = torch.nn.functional.fold(out_unf, (7, 8), (1, 1))
        >>> # or equivalently (and avoiding a copy),
        >>> # out = out_unf.view(1, 2, 7, 8)
        >>> (torch.nn.functional.conv2d(inp, w) - out).abs().max()
        tensor(1.9073e-06)

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly specified for the API to function correctly.  
    - "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": Pairs of parameters that cannot be used together in a single call due to logical or operational conflicts.  
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" refer to parameter pairs that are not universally mutually exclusive but become incompatible only under specific conditions. In these cases, the mutual exclusion depends on certain value combinations, e.g., the parameters conflict only when both assume particular values or satisfy certain conditions based on their assigned values. Thus, these are a subset of "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" that exhibit conditional, rather than absolute, exclusivity.
    - "Mandatory coexistence parameters": Sets of parameters that must be provided together to ensure valid configuration or meaningful behavior.
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters": When the parameters meet certain conditions, it will prevent the function from running.

    ---
    3. Your Tasks:

    Based on the documentation and definitions provided:

    1. Determine the Type of Each Parameter.
    For each explicitly defined parameter in [fun_string], determine its type, such as: tensor, int, str, optional tensor, etc.
    2. Identify Parameter Dependency Structures as accurately and completely as possible:
    - List all "Mandatory Parameters"  
    - Identify any "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs"  
    - Identify any "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" 
    - Identify any "Mandatory Coexistence Parameters"

    ---
    4.Output Format:
    
    {
    "Parameter type": {
        "input": "...",
        "weight": "...",
        "bias": "...",
        "stride": "...",
        "padding": "...",
        "dilation": "...",
        "groups": "..."
    },
    "Mandatory Parameters": ["...", "..."],
    "Mutually Exclusive Parameter Pairs": [["...", "..."], ...],
    "Mandatory Coexistence Parameters": [["...", "...", "..."], ["...", "..."], ...],
    "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters":["para_1", "para_2","(condition)"],
    }

    Note: The output should be in JSON format, but for the purpose of this exercise, you can present it in a structured markdown table or similar format.

    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.SyncBatchNorm]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [Applies Batch Normalization over a N-Dimensional input.

    The N-D input is a mini-batch of [N-2]D inputs with additional channel dimension) as described in the paper
    `Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing
    Internal Covariate Shift <https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167>`__ .

    .. math::

        y = \frac{x - \mathrm{E}[x]}{ \sqrt{\mathrm{Var}[x] + \epsilon}} * \gamma + \beta

    The mean and standard-deviation are calculated per-dimension over all
    mini-batches of the same process groups. :math:`\gamma` and :math:`\beta`
    are learnable parameter vectors of size `C` (where `C` is the input size).
    By default, the elements of :math:`\gamma` are sampled from
    :math:`\mathcal{U}(0, 1)` and the elements of :math:`\beta` are set to 0.
    The standard-deviation is calculated via the biased estimator, equivalent to
    `torch.var(input, unbiased=False)`.

    Also by default, during training this layer keeps running estimates of its
    computed mean and variance, which are then used for normalization during
    evaluation. The running estimates are kept with a default :attr:`momentum`
    of 0.1.

    If :attr:`track_running_stats` is set to ``False``, this layer then does not
    keep running estimates, and batch statistics are instead used during
    evaluation time as well.

    .. note::
        This :attr:`momentum` argument is different from one used in optimizer
        classes and the conventional notion of momentum. Mathematically, the
        update rule for running statistics here is
        :math:`\hat{x}_\text{new} = (1 - \text{momentum}) \times \hat{x} + \text{momentum} \times x_t`,
        where :math:`\hat{x}` is the estimated statistic and :math:`x_t` is the
        new observed value.

    Because the Batch Normalization is done for each channel in the ``C`` dimension, computing
    statistics on ``(N, +)`` slices, it's common terminology to call this Volumetric Batch
    Normalization or Spatio-temporal Batch Normalization.

    Currently :class:`SyncBatchNorm` only supports
    :class:`~torch.nn.DistributedDataParallel` (DDP) with single GPU per process. Use
    :meth:`torch.nn.SyncBatchNorm.convert_sync_batchnorm()` to convert
    :attr:`BatchNorm*D` layer to :class:`SyncBatchNorm` before wrapping
    Network with DDP.

    Args:
        num_features: :math:`C` from an expected input of size
            :math:`(N, C, +)`
        eps: a value added to the denominator for numerical stability.
            Default: ``1e-5``
        momentum: the value used for the running_mean and running_var
            computation. Can be set to ``None`` for cumulative moving average
            (i.e. simple average). Default: 0.1
        affine: a boolean value that when set to ``True``, this module has
            learnable affine parameters. Default: ``True``
        track_running_stats: a boolean value that when set to ``True``, this
            module tracks the running mean and variance, and when set to ``False``,
            this module does not track such statistics, and initializes statistics
            buffers :attr:`running_mean` and :attr:`running_var` as ``None``.
            When these buffers are ``None``, this module always uses batch statistics.
            in both training and eval modes. Default: ``True``
        process_group: synchronization of stats happen within each process group
            individually. Default behavior is synchronization across the whole
            world

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, C, +)`
        - Output: :math:`(N, C, +)` (same shape as input)

    .. note::
        Synchronization of batchnorm statistics occurs only while training, i.e.
        synchronization is disabled when ``model.eval()`` is set or if
        ``self.training`` is otherwise ``False``.

    Examples::

        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP
        >>> # With Learnable Parameters
        >>> m = nn.SyncBatchNorm(100)
        >>> # creating process group (optional)
        >>> # ranks is a list of int identifying rank ids.
        >>> ranks = list(range(8))
        >>> r1, r2 = ranks[:4], ranks[4:]
        >>> # Note: every rank calls into new_group for every
        >>> # process group created, even if that rank is not
        >>> # part of the group.
        >>> process_groups = [torch.distributed.new_group(pids) for pids in [r1, r2]]
        >>> process_group = process_groups[0 if dist.get_rank() <= 3 else 1]
        >>> # Without Learnable Parameters
        >>> m = nn.BatchNorm3d(100, affine=False, process_group=process_group)
        >>> input = torch.randn(20, 100, 35, 45, 10)
        >>> output = m(input)

        >>> # network is nn.BatchNorm layer
        >>> sync_bn_network = nn.SyncBatchNorm.convert_sync_batchnorm(network, process_group)
        >>> # only single gpu per process is currently supported
        >>> ddp_sync_bn_network = torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(
        >>>                         sync_bn_network,
        >>>                         device_ids=[args.local_rank],
        >>>                         output_device=args.local_rank)
    ]

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly specified for the API to function correctly.  
    - "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": Pairs of parameters that cannot be used together in a single call due to logical or operational conflicts.  
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" refer to parameter pairs that are not universally mutually exclusive but become incompatible only under specific conditions. In these cases, the mutual exclusion depends on certain value combinations, e.g., the parameters conflict only when both assume particular values or satisfy certain conditions based on their assigned values. Thus, these are a subset of "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" that exhibit conditional, rather than absolute, exclusivity.
    - "Mandatory coexistence parameters": Sets of parameters that must be provided together to ensure valid configuration or meaningful behavior.
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters": When the parameters meet certain conditions, it will prevent the function from running.

    3. Your Tasks:

    Based on the documentation and definitions provided:

    1. Determine the Type of Each Parameter.
    For each explicitly defined parameter in [fun_string], determine its type, such as: tensor, int, str, optional tensor, etc.
    2. Identify Parameter Dependency Structures as accurately and completely as possible:
    - List all "Mandatory Parameters"  
    - Identify any "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs"  
    - Identify any "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" 
    - Identify any "Mandatory Coexistence Parameters"

    }

    ---
    6. Instructions:

    - For the "Parameter type" section, you need to specify the type of each parameter, including any constraints on their shape or possible values. For example, if a parameter is a tensor, specify its shape. If it's an integer, specify if it's positive, etc.
    - For the "Mandatory Parameters" section, list all parameters that must be provided for the API to function correctly. These are parameters without default values, or parameters that are required for the API's core functionality.
    - For the "Mutually Exclusive Parameter Pairs" section, list all pairs of parameters that cannot be used together. For example, if two parameters cannot be set simultaneously, they form a mutual exclusion pair.
    - For the "Mandatory Coexistence Parameters" section, list all sets of parameters that must be provided together. For example, if parameter A requires parameter B to be set, they must coexist.
    - For the "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters" section, list all parameter pairs that are mutually exclusive only under certain conditions. For example, if parameter A and B cannot be used together only when a certain condition is met (e.g., both are greater than 1).

        You are an expert in [torch], with deep knowledge of its API design, functionality, and practical usage across a wide range of scenarios.

    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.RNN]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [__init__(input_size,hidden_size,num_layers=1,nonlinearity='tanh',bias=True,batch_first=False,dropout=0.0,bidirectional=False,device=None,dtype=None)

    Apply a multi-layer Elman RNN with :math:`\tanh` or :math:`\text{ReLU}`
    non-linearity to an input sequence. For each element in the input sequence,
    each layer computes the following function:

    .. math::
        h_t = \tanh(x_t W_{ih}^T + b_{ih} + h_{t-1}W_{hh}^T + b_{hh})

    where :math:`h_t` is the hidden state at time `t`, :math:`x_t` is
    the input at time `t`, and :math:`h_{(t-1)}` is the hidden state of the
    previous layer at time `t-1` or the initial hidden state at time `0`.
    If :attr:`nonlinearity` is ``'relu'``, then :math:`\text{ReLU}` is used instead of :math:`\tanh`.

    .. code-block:: python

        # Efficient implementation equivalent to the following with bidirectional=False
        def forward(x, h_0=None):
            if batch_first:
                x = x.transpose(0, 1)
            seq_len, batch_size, _ = x.size()
            if h_0 is None:
                h_0 = torch.zeros(num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size)
            h_t_minus_1 = h_0
            h_t = h_0
            output = []
            for t in range(seq_len):
                for layer in range(num_layers):
                    h_t[layer] = torch.tanh(
                        x[t] @ weight_ih[layer].T
                        + bias_ih[layer]
                        + h_t_minus_1[layer] @ weight_hh[layer].T
                        + bias_hh[layer]
                    )
                output.append(h_t[-1])
                h_t_minus_1 = h_t
            output = torch.stack(output)
            if batch_first:
                output = output.transpose(0, 1)
            return output, h_t

    Args:
        input_size: The number of expected features in the input `x`
        hidden_size: The number of features in the hidden state `h`
        num_layers: Number of recurrent layers. E.g., setting ``num_layers=2``
            would mean stacking two RNNs together to form a `stacked RNN`,
            with the second RNN taking in outputs of the first RNN and
            computing the final results. Default: 1
        nonlinearity: The non-linearity to use. Can be either ``'tanh'`` or ``'relu'``. Default: ``'tanh'``
        bias: If ``False``, then the layer does not use bias weights `b_ih` and `b_hh`.
            Default: ``True``
        batch_first: If ``True``, then the input and output tensors are provided
            as `(batch, seq, feature)` instead of `(seq, batch, feature)`.
            Note that this does not apply to hidden or cell states. See the
            Inputs/Outputs sections below for details.  Default: ``False``
        dropout: If non-zero, introduces a `Dropout` layer on the outputs of each
            RNN layer except the last layer, with dropout probability equal to
            :attr:`dropout`. Default: 0
        bidirectional: If ``True``, becomes a bidirectional RNN. Default: ``False``

    Inputs: input, h_0
        * **input**: tensor of shape :math:`(L, H_{in})` for unbatched input,
          :math:`(L, N, H_{in})` when ``batch_first=False`` or
          :math:`(N, L, H_{in})` when ``batch_first=True`` containing the features of
          the input sequence.  The input can also be a packed variable length sequence.
          See :func:`torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence` or
          :func:`torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_sequence` for details.
        * **h_0**: tensor of shape :math:`(D * \text{num\_layers}, H_{out})` for unbatched input or
          :math:`(D * \text{num\_layers}, N, H_{out})` containing the initial hidden
          state for the input sequence batch. Defaults to zeros if not provided.

        where:

        .. math::
            \begin{aligned}

                L ={} & \text{sequence length} \\

                H_{out} ={} & \text{hidden\_size}
            \end{aligned}

    Outputs: output, h_n
        * **output**: tensor of shape :math:`(L, D * H_{out})` for unbatched input,
          :math:`(L, N, D * H_{out})` when ``batch_first=False`` or
          :math:`(N, L, D * H_{out})` when ``batch_first=True`` containing the output features
          `(h_t)` from the last layer of the RNN, for each `t`. If a
          :class:`torch.nn.utils.rnn.PackedSequence` has been given as the input, the output
          will also be a packed sequence.
        * **h_n**: tensor of shape :math:`(D * \text{num\_layers}, H_{out})` for unbatched input or
          :math:`(D * \text{num\_layers}, N, H_{out})` containing the final hidden state
          for each element in the batch.

    Attributes:
        weight_ih_l[k]: the learnable input-hidden weights of the k-th layer,
            of shape `(hidden_size, input_size)` for `k = 0`. Otherwise, the shape is
            `(hidden_size, num_directions * hidden_size)`
        weight_hh_l[k]: the learnable hidden-hidden weights of the k-th layer,
            of shape `(hidden_size, hidden_size)`
        bias_ih_l[k]: the learnable input-hidden bias of the k-th layer,
            of shape `(hidden_size)`
        bias_hh_l[k]: the learnable hidden-hidden bias of the k-th layer,
            of shape `(hidden_size)`

    .. note::
        All the weights and biases are initialized from :math:`\mathcal{U}(-\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{k})`
        where :math:`k = \frac{1}{\text{hidden\_size}}`

    .. note::
        For bidirectional RNNs, forward and backward are directions 0 and 1 respectively.
        Example of splitting the output layers when ``batch_first=False``:
        ``output.view(seq_len, batch, num_directions, hidden_size)``.

    .. note::
        ``batch_first`` argument is ignored for unbatched inputs.

    .. include:: ../cudnn_rnn_determinism.rst

    .. include:: ../cudnn_persistent_rnn.rst

    Examples::

        >>> rnn = nn.RNN(10, 20, 2)
        >>> input = torch.randn(5, 3, 10)
        >>> h0 = torch.randn(2, 3, 20)
        >>> output, hn = rnn(input, h0)

In these cases, the mutual exclusion depends on certain value combinations, e.g., the parameters conflict only when both assume particular values or satisfy certain conditions based on their assigned values. Thus, these are a subset of "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" that exhibit conditional, rather than absolute, exclusivity.
    - "Mandatory coexistence parameters": Sets of parameters that must be provided together to ensure valid configuration or meaningful behavior.
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters": When the parameters meet certain conditions, it will prevent the function from running.

| dtype          | Optional Parameter       | Default is None. Specifies the data type for parameters.                  |

### 2. Parameter Relationships

| Parameter 1 | Parameter 2 | Relationship Type               | Condition                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### 3. Summary

The `torch.nn.RNN` API has several parameters with specific dependencies. `input_size` and `hidden_size` are mandatory. `num_layers` and `bidirectional` interact conditionally, as do `batch_first` and input/output shapes. `dropout` requires `num_layers` > 1 when active.

### 4. Usage Example

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define the RNN
rnn = nn.RNN(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, num_layers=2, nonlinearity='relu', 
             bias=True, batch_first=True, dropout=0.2, bidirectional=True)

# Input tensor
input = torch.randn(3, 5, 10)  # batch_size=3, seq_len=5, input_size=10

# Initial hidden state
h0 = torch.randn(2 * 2, 3, 20)  # num_layers * num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size

# Forward pass
output, hn = rnn(input, h0)
print(output.size())  # Should be (3, 5, 40) since bidirectional doubles hidden_size
print(hn.size())      # Should be (4, 3, 20)
```

### 5. Pitfall Example

```python
# Incorrect usage: Using dropout without multiple layers
rnn = nn.RNN(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, num_layers=1, dropout=0.5)
```

### 6. Correction for the Pitfall

```python
# Corrected usage: Ensure num_layers > 1 when using dropout
rnn = nn.RNN(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, num_layers=2, dropout=0.5)
```

### 7. Comprehensive Explanation

The `torch.nn.RNN` API requires careful consideration of parameter interactions. `input_size` and `hidden_size` are essential for defining the network's structure. `num_layers` determines the depth, while `bidirectional` affects the directionality, doubling the hidden state size. `batch_first` changes data handling, impacting input and output shapes. `dropout` is only effective with multiple layers, necessitating `num_layers` > 1. Understanding these relationships prevents errors and ensures correct model configuration.

### 8. Conclusion

The `torch.nn.RNN` API offers flexibility through various parameters, but their correct usage hinges on understanding their dependencies. Proper configuration ensures the model functions as intended, avoiding common pitfalls related to parameter interactions.

    1. Role:
        You are an expert in [torch], with deep knowledge of its API design, functionality, and practical usage across a wide range of scenarios.

    ---
    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.LSTM]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [__init__(input_size,hidden_size,num_layers=1,bias=True,batch_first=False,dropout=0.0,bidirectional=False,proj_size=0,device=None,dtype=None)

    Apply a multi-layer long short-term memory (LSTM) RNN to an input sequence.
    For each element in the input sequence, each layer computes the following
    function:

    .. math::
        \begin{array}{ll} \\
            i_t = \sigma(W_{ii} x_t + b_{ii} + W_{hi} h_{t-1} + b_{hi}) \\
            f_t = \sigma(W_{if} x_t + b_{if} + W_{hf} h_{t-1} + b_{hf}) \\
            g_t = \tanh(W_{ig} x_t + b_{ig} + W_{hg} h_{t-1} + b_{hg}) \\
            o_t = \sigma(W_{io} x_t + b_{io} + W_{ho} h_{t-1} + b_{ho}) \\
            c_t = f_t \odot c_{t-1} + i_t \odot g_t \\
            h_t = o_t \odot \tanh(c_t) \\
        \end{array}

    where :math:`h_t` is the hidden state at time `t`, :math:`c_t` is the cell
    state at time `t`, :math:`x_t` is the input at time `t`, :math:`h_{t-1}`
    is the hidden state of the layer at time `t-1` or the initial hidden
    state at time `0`, and :math:`i_t`, :math:`f_t`, :math:`g_t`,
    :math:`o_t` are the input, forget, cell, and output gates, respectively.
    :math:`\sigma` is the sigmoid function, and :math:`\odot` is the Hadamard product.

    In a multilayer LSTM, the input :math:`x^{(l)}_t` of the :math:`l` -th layer
    (:math:`l \ge 2`) is the hidden state :math:`h^{(l-1)}_t` of the previous layer multiplied by
    dropout :math:`\delta^{(l-1)}_t` where each :math:`\delta^{(l-1)}_t` is a Bernoulli random
    variable which is :math:`0` with probability :attr:`dropout`.

    If ``proj_size > 0`` is specified, LSTM with projections will be used. This changes
    the LSTM cell in the following way. First, the dimension of :math:`h_t` will be changed from
    ``hidden_size`` to ``proj_size`` (dimensions of :math:`W_{hi}` will be changed accordingly).
    Second, the output hidden state of each layer will be multiplied by a learnable projection
    matrix: :math:`h_t = W_{hr}h_t`. Note that as a consequence of this, the output
    of LSTM network will be of different shape as well. See Inputs/Outputs sections below for exact
    dimensions of all variables. You can find more details in https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1128.

    Args:
        input_size: The number of expected features in the input `x`
        hidden_size: The number of features in the hidden state `h`
        num_layers: Number of recurrent layers. E.g., setting ``num_layers=2``
            would mean stacking two LSTMs together to form a `stacked LSTM`,
            with the second LSTM taking in outputs of the first LSTM and
            computing the final results. Default: 1
        bias: If ``False``, then the layer does not use bias weights `b_ih` and `b_hh`.
            Default: ``True``
        batch_first: If ``True``, then the input and output tensors are provided
            as `(batch, seq, feature)` instead of `(seq, batch, feature)`.
            Note that this does not apply to hidden or cell states. See the
            Inputs/Outputs sections below for details.  Default: ``False``
        dropout: If non-zero, introduces a `Dropout` layer on the outputs of each
            LSTM layer except the last layer, with dropout probability equal to
            :attr:`dropout`. Default: 0
        bidirectional: If ``True``, becomes a bidirectional LSTM. Default: ``False``
        proj_size: If ``> 0``, will use LSTM with projections of corresponding size. Default: 0

          `(h_t)` from the last layer of the LSTM, for each `t`. If a

Padding sequences to a fixed length is a common approach, but it can introduce unnecessary computations and affect model performance, particularly with large datasets. This guide explains how to handle variable-length sequences without padding, focusing on best practices for batch processing and efficient computation.

The LSTM layer in PyTorch, `torch.nn.LSTM`, is designed to process sequences of varying lengths. It supports both batched and unbatched inputs, making it versatile for different use cases. The key to efficiently handling variable-length sequences lies in using packed sequences, which allow the LSTM to process each sequence up to its actual length without padding.

### Key Parameters of `torch.nn.LSTM`

- **input_size**: Number of features in the input.
- **hidden_size**: Number of features in the hidden state.
- **num_layers**: Number of recurrent layers.
- **batch_first**: If `True`, the input and output tensors are `(batch, seq, feature)` instead of `(seq, batch, feature)`.
- **bidirectional**: If `True`, becomes a bidirectional LSTM.
- **proj_size**: If `> 0`, uses LSTM with projections.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **input**: Can be a tensor or a packed sequence.
- **h_0, c_0**: Initial hidden and cell states.
- **output**: Output features from the last layer.
- **h_n, c_n**: Final hidden and cell states.

## Handling Variable-Length Sequences

### Why Padding is Not Ideal

Padding sequences to the same length can lead to:

- **Increased computation**: Processing unnecessary zero values.
- **Memory overhead**: Storing padded zeros in tensors.
- **Information loss**: Padding can introduce noise, affecting model performance.

### Using Packed Sequences

PyTorch provides utilities to handle variable-length sequences efficiently:

- **`torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence`**: Converts padded sequences into packed sequences.
- **`torch.nn.utils.rnn.pad_packed_sequence`**: Converts packed sequences back to padded form.

#### Steps to Use Packed Sequences

1. **Sort Sequences by Length**: For efficient packing, sort sequences in descending order of length.
2. **Pad Sequences**: Pad all sequences to the maximum length in the batch.
3. **Pack Sequences**: Use `pack_padded_sequence` to create a packed sequence.
4. **Process with LSTM**: Feed the packed sequence into the LSTM layer.
5. **Unpack Sequences**: Use `pad_packed_sequence` to convert the output back to padded form.

#### Example Code

```python
import torch
from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pack_padded_sequence, pad_packed_sequence

# Example batch with variable-length sequences
sequences = [
    torch.randn(3, 10),  # Sequence length 3
    torch.randn(5, 10),  # Sequence length 5
    torch.randn(4, 10)   # Sequence length 4
]

# Step 1: Sort sequences by length in descending order
sorted_sequences = sorted(sequences, key=lambda x: x.size(0), reverse=True)
lengths = [seq.size(0) for seq in sorted_sequences]

# Step 2: Pad sequences to the maximum length
max_length = max(lengths)
padded_sequences = torch.nn.utils.rnn.pad_sequence(sorted_sequences, batch_first=True)

# Step 3: Pack the padded sequences
packed_input = pack_padded_sequence(padded_sequences, lengths, batch_first=True, enforce_sorted=True)

# Step 4: Define and process with LSTM
lstm = torch.nn.LSTM(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, batch_first=True)
output, (h_n

        You are an expert in [torch], with deep knowledge of its API design, functionality, and practical usage across a wide range of scenarios.

    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.GRU]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [__init__(input_size,hidden_size,num_layers=1,bias=True,batch_first=False,dropout=0.0,bidirectional=False,device=None,dtype=None)

    Apply a multi-layer gated recurrent unit (GRU) RNN to an input sequence.
    For each element in the input sequence, each layer computes the following
    function:

    .. math::
        \begin{array}{ll}
            r_t = \sigma(W_{ir} x_t + b_{ir} + W_{hr} h_{(t-1)} + b_{hr}) \\
            z_t = \sigma(W_{iz} x_t + b_{iz} + W_{hz} h_{(t-1)} + b_{hz}) \\
            n_t = \tanh(W_{in} x_t + b_{in} + r_t \odot (W_{hn} h_{(t-1)}+ b_{hn})) \\
            h_t = (1 - z_t) \odot n_t + z_t \odot h_{(t-1)}
        \end{array}

    where :math:`h_t` is the hidden state at time `t`, :math:`x_t` is the input
    at time `t`, :math:`h_{(t-1)}` is the hidden state of the layer
    at time `t-1` or the initial hidden state at time `0`, and :math:`r_t`,
    :math:`z_t`, :math:`n_t` are the reset, update, and new gates, respectively.
    :math:`\sigma` is the sigmoid function, and :math:`\odot` is the Hadamard product.

    In a multilayer GRU, the input :math:`x^{(l)}_t` of the :math:`l` -th layer
    (:math:`l \ge 2`) is the hidden state :math:`h^{(l-1)}_t` of the previous layer multiplied by
    dropout :math:`\delta^{(l-1)}_t` where each :math:`\delta^{(l-1)}_t` is a Bernoulli random
    variable which is :math:`0` with probability :attr:`dropout`.

    Args:
        input_size: The number of expected features in the input `x`
        hidden_size: The number of features in the hidden state `h`
        num_layers: Number of recurrent layers. E.g., setting ``num_layers=2``
            would mean stacking two GRUs together to form a `stacked GRU`,
            with the second GRU taking in outputs of the first GRU and
            computing the final results. Default: 1
        bias: If ``False``, then the layer does not use bias weights `b_ih` and `b_hh`.
            Default: ``True``
        batch_first: If ``True``, then the input and output tensors are provided
            as `(batch, seq, feature)` instead of `(seq, batch, feature)`.
            Note that this does not apply to hidden or cell states. See the
            Inputs/Outputs sections below for details.  Default: ``False``
        dropout: If non-zero, introduces a `Dropout` layer on the outputs of each
            GRU layer except the last layer, with dropout probability equal to
            :attr:`dropout`. Default: 0
        bidirectional: If ``True``, becomes a bidirectional GRU. Default: ``False``

    Inputs: input, h_0
        * **input**: tensor of shape :math:`(L, H_{in})` for unbatched input,
          :math:`(L, N, H_{in})` when ``batch_first=False`` or
          :math:`(N, L, H_{in})` when ``batch_first=True`` containing the features of
          the input sequence.  The input can also be a packed variable length sequence.
          See :func:`torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence` or
          :func:`torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_sequence` for details.
        * **h_0**: tensor of shape :math:`(D * \text{num\_layers}, H_{out})` or
          :math:`(D * \text{num\_layers}, N, H_{out})`
          containing the initial hidden state for the input sequence. Defaults to zeros if not provided.

        where:

        .. math::
            \begin{aligned}
                N ={} & \text{batch size} \\
                L ={} & \text{sequence length} \\
                D ={} & 2 \text{ if bidirectional=True otherwise } 1 \\
                H_{in} ={} & \text{input\_size} \\
                H_{out} ={} & \text{hidden\_size}
            \end{aligned}

    Outputs: output, h_n
        * **output**: tensor of shape :math:`(L, D * H_{out})` for unbatched input,
          :math:`(L, N, D * H_{out})` when ``batch_first=False`` or
          :math:`(N, L, D * H_{out})` when ``batch_first=True`` containing the output features
          `(h_t)` from the last layer of the GRU, for each `t`. If a
          :class:`torch.nn.utils.rnn.PackedSequence` has been given as the input, the output
          will also be a packed sequence.
        * **h_n**: tensor of shape :math:`(D * \text{num\_layers}, H_{out})` or
          :math:`(D * \text{num\_layers}, N, H_{out})` containing the final hidden state
          for the input sequence.

    Attributes:
        weight_ih_l[k] : the learnable input-hidden weights of the :math:`\text{k}^{th}` layer
            (W_ir|W_iz|W_in), of shape `(3*hidden_size, input_size)` for `k = 0`.
            Otherwise, the shape is `(3*hidden_size, num_directions * hidden_size)`
        weight_hh_l[k] : the learnable hidden-hidden weights of the :math:`\text{k}^{th}` layer
            (W_hr|W_hz|W_hn), of shape `(3*hidden_size, hidden_size)`
        bias_ih_l[k] : the learnable input-hidden bias of the :math:`\text{k}^{th}` layer
            (b_ir|b_iz|b_in), of shape `(3*hidden_size)`
        bias_hh_l[k] : the learnable hidden-hidden bias of the :math:`\text{k}^{th}` layer
            (b_hr|b_hz|b_hn), of shape `(3*hidden_size)`

    .. note::
        All the weights and biases are initialized from :math:`\mathcal{U}(-\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{k})`
        where :math:`k = \frac{1}{\text{hidden\_size}}`

    .. note::
        For bidirectional GRUs, forward and backward are directions 0 and 1 respectively.
        Example of splitting the output layers when ``batch_first=False``:
        ``output.view(seq_len, batch, num_directions, hidden_size)``.

    .. note::
        ``batch_first`` argument is ignored for unbatched inputs.

    .. note::
        The calculation of new gate :math:`n_t` subtly differs from the original paper and other frameworks.
        In the original implementation, the Hadamard product :math:`(\odot)` between :math:`r_t` and the
        previous hidden state :math:`h_{(t-1)}` is done before the multiplication with the weight matrix
        `W` and addition of bias:

        .. math::
            \begin{aligned}
                n_t = \tanh(W_{in} x_t + b_{in} + W_{hn} ( r_t \odot h_{(t-1)} ) + b_{hn})
            \end{aligned}

        This is in contrast to PyTorch implementation, which is done after :math:`W_{hn} h_{(t-1)}`

        .. math::
            \begin{aligned}
                n_t = \tanh(W_{in} x_t + b_{in} + r_t \odot (W_{hn} h_{(t-1)}+ b_{hn}))
            \end{aligned}

        This implementation differs on purpose for efficiency.

    .. include:: ../cudnn_persistent_rnn.rst

    Examples::

        >>> rnn = nn.GRU(10, 20, 2)
        >>> input = torch.randn(5, 3, 10)
        >>> h0 = torch.randn(2, 3, 20)
        >>> output, hn = rnn(input, h0)
    ]

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning, parameters can be dependent on each other in various ways. For the purpose of this task, we are focusing on the following types of dependencies:

    - **Weight Matrix Initialization**: How the weights are initialized, including the distribution, scaling, etc.
    - **Weight Matrix Update**: How the weights are updated during training, including gradient computation, optimization, etc.
    - **Weight Matrix Sharing**: Whether the same weights are used across different layers or operations.

# Analysis of Parameter Dependencies in torch.nn.GRU

## Introduction

The `torch.nn.GRU` API is a widely used implementation of the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model in PyTorch. GRUs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that addresses the vanishing gradient problem through the use of gates. This report analyzes the parameter dependencies within the `torch.nn.GRU` API, focusing on eight specific types of dependencies: initialization, update, sharing, combination, regularization, constraints, initialization order, and initialization correlation. Understanding these dependencies is crucial for effective model training and inference.

## Parameter Dependencies Analysis

### 1. Weight Matrix Initialization

**Existence**: Yes  
**Details**: The weights in `torch.nn.GRU` are initialized from a uniform distribution :math:`\mathcal{U}(-\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{k})`, where :math:`k = \frac{1}{\text{hidden\_size}}`. This initialization helps in maintaining the variance of activations across layers, preventing the gradients from exploding or vanishing during training.  
**Implications**: Proper initialization ensures that the model starts training in a stable region, facilitating faster convergence and better performance.

### 2. Weight Matrix Update

**Existence**: Yes  
**Details**: The weights are updated during training through backpropagation. The gradients are computed using the chain rule, and optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam, etc., are used to update the weights. The update process depends on the loss function and the optimizer's parameters (e.g., learning rate, momentum).  
**Implications**: The choice of optimizer and learning rate significantly affects the model's training dynamics and final performance. Proper weight updates are essential for learning meaningful representations.

### 3. Weight Matrix Sharing

**Existence**: No  
**Details**: In `torch.nn.GRU`, each layer has its own set of weights, and there is no explicit sharing of weights across layers or directions (forward and backward in bidirectional GRUs).  
**Implications**: No sharing allows each layer to learn distinct features, which can be beneficial for capturing complex patterns in the data.

### 4. Weight Matrix Combination

**Existence**: Yes  
**Details**: Within each layer, the input-hidden and hidden-hidden weights are combined through matrix multiplications and element-wise operations (e.g., Hadamard product). For example, the reset gate computation combines input and hidden states using the respective weights.  
**Implications**: The combination of weights allows the model to capture complex interactions between the input and hidden states, enabling the learning of sophisticated temporal dependencies.

### 5. Weight Matrix Regularization

**Existence**: Yes  
**Details**: Dropout is applied between layers, as specified by the `dropout` parameter. This technique randomly zeros out some elements of the output from each layer, preventing overfitting.  
**Implications**: Regularization helps in making the model more robust by reducing overfitting, especially when the model is deep or the training data is limited.

### 6. Weight Matrix Constraints

**Existence**: No  
**Details**: There are no explicit constraints (e.g., non-negativity, orthogonality) imposed on the weight matrices in `torch.nn.GRU`.  
**Implications**: The absence of constraints allows the model to learn a wide variety of representations, but it may require careful initialization and regularization to prevent issues like exploding gradients.

### 7. Weight Matrix Initialization Order

**Existence**: Yes  
**Details**: The weights are initialized in a specific order: input-hidden weights first, followed by hidden-hidden weights. This order is consistent across all layers and directions.  
**Implications**: The initialization order ensures that the weights are set up correctly for the forward and backward passes, maintaining the integrity of the computation graph.

### 8. Weight Matrix Initialization Correlation

**Existence**: No  
**Details**: The initialization of one weight matrix is independent of others. Each weight matrix is initialized based solely on its dimensions and the hidden size.  
**Implications**: Independence in initialization allows each layer to start with its own set of parameters, which can be beneficial for learning diverse features across layers.

## Conclusion

The `torch.nn.GRU` API exhibits several key parameter dependencies that are critical for its operation and performance. Proper weight initialization ensures stable training, while weight updates and regularization techniques like dropout help in learning robust models. The absence of weight sharing and constraints allows flexibility in learning, while the order and independence of initializations maintain the model's structural integrity. Understanding these dependencies is essential for effectively utilizing the GRU API in various deep learning applications.

    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.Embedding]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [A simple lookup table that stores embeddings of a fixed dictionary and size.

    This module is often used to store word embeddings and retrieve them using indices.
    The input to the module is a list of indices, and the output is the corresponding
    word embeddings.

    Args:
        num_embeddings (int): size of the dictionary of embeddings
        embedding_dim (int): the size of each embedding vector
        padding_idx (int, optional): If specified, the entries at :attr:`padding_idx` do not contribute to the gradient;
                                     therefore, the embedding vector at :attr:`padding_idx` is not updated during training,
                                     i.e. it remains as a fixed "pad". For a newly constructed Embedding,
                                     the embedding vector at :attr:`padding_idx` will default to all zeros,
                                     but can be updated to another value to be used as the padding vector.
        max_norm (float, optional): If given, each embedding vector with norm larger than :attr:`max_norm`
                                    is renormalized to have norm :attr:`max_norm`.
        norm_type (float, optional): The p of the p-norm to compute for the :attr:`max_norm` option. Default ``2``.
        scale_grad_by_freq (bool, optional): If given, this will scale gradients by the inverse of frequency of
                                                the words in the mini-batch. Default ``False``.
        sparse (bool, optional): If ``True``, gradient w.r.t. :attr:`weight` matrix will be a sparse tensor.
                                 See Notes for more details regarding sparse gradients.

    Attributes:
        weight (Tensor): the learnable weights of the module of shape (num_embeddings, embedding_dim)
                         initialized from :math:`\mathcal{N}(0, 1)`

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(*)`, IntTensor or LongTensor of arbitrary shape containing the indices to extract
        - Output: :math:`(*, H)`, where `*` is the input shape and :math:`H=\text{embedding\_dim}`

    .. note::
        Keep in mind that only a limited number of optimizers support
        sparse gradients: currently it's :class:`optim.SGD` (`CUDA` and `CPU`),
        :class:`optim.SparseAdam` (`CUDA` and `CPU`) and :class:`optim.Adagrad` (`CPU`)

    .. note::
        When :attr:`max_norm` is not ``None``, :class:`Embedding`'s forward method will modify the
        :attr:`weight` tensor in-place. Since tensors needed for gradient computations cannot be
        modified in-place, performing a differentiable operation on ``Embedding.weight`` before
        calling :class:`Embedding`'s forward method requires cloning ``Embedding.weight`` when
        :attr:`max_norm` is not ``None``. For example::

            n, d, m = 3, 5, 7
            embedding = nn.Embedding(n, d, max_norm=1.0)
            W = torch.randn((m, d), requires_grad=True)
            idx = torch.tensor([1, 2])
            a = embedding.weight.clone() @ W.t()  # weight must be cloned for this to be differentiable
            b = embedding(idx) @ W.t()  # modifies weight in-place
            out = (a.unsqueeze(0) + b.unsqueeze(1))
            loss = out.sigmoid().prod()
            loss.backward()

    Examples::

        >>> # an Embedding module containing 10 tensors of size 3
        >>> embedding = nn.Embedding(10, 3)
        >>> # a batch of 2 samples of 4 indices each

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly specified for the API to function correctly.  
    - "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": Pairs of parameters that cannot be used together in a single call due to logical or operational conflicts.  
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" refer to parameter pairs that are not universally mutually exclusive but become incompatible only under specific conditions. In these cases, the mutual exclusion depends on certain value combinations, e.g., the parameters conflict only when both assume particular values or satisfy certain conditions based on their assigned values. Thus, these are a subset of "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" that exhibit conditional, rather than absolute, exclusivity.
    - "Mandatory coexistence parameters": Sets of parameters that must be provided together to ensure valid configuration or meaningful behavior.
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters": When the parameters meet certain conditions, it will prevent the function from running.

    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.EmbeddingBag]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [Compute sums or means of 'bags' of embeddings, without instantiating the intermediate embeddings.

    For bags of constant length, no :attr:`per_sample_weights`, no indices equal to :attr:`padding_idx`,
    and with 2D inputs, this class

        * with ``mode="sum"`` is equivalent to :class:`~torch.nn.Embedding` followed by ``torch.sum(dim=1)``,
        * with ``mode="mean"`` is equivalent to :class:`~torch.nn.Embedding` followed by ``torch.mean(dim=1)``,
        * with ``mode="max"`` is equivalent to :class:`~torch.nn.Embedding` followed by ``torch.max(dim=1)``.

    However, :class:`~torch.nn.EmbeddingBag` is much more time and memory efficient than using a chain of these
    operations.

    EmbeddingBag also supports per-sample weights as an argument to the forward
    pass. This scales the output of the Embedding before performing a weighted
    reduction as specified by ``mode``. If :attr:`per_sample_weights` is passed, the
    only supported ``mode`` is ``"sum"``, which computes a weighted sum according to
    :attr:`per_sample_weights`.

    Args:
        num_embeddings (int): size of the dictionary of embeddings
        embedding_dim (int): the size of each embedding vector
        max_norm (float, optional): If given, each embedding vector with norm larger than :attr:`max_norm`
                                    is renormalized to have norm :attr:`max_norm`.
        norm_type (float, optional): The p of the p-norm to compute for the :attr:`max_norm` option. Default ``2``.
        scale_grad_by_freq (bool, optional): if given, this will scale gradients by the inverse of frequency of
                                                the words in the mini-batch. Default ``False``.
                                                Note: this option is not supported when ``mode="max"``.
        mode (str, optional): ``"sum"``, ``"mean"`` or ``"max"``. Specifies the way to reduce the bag.
                                 ``"sum"`` computes the weighted sum, taking :attr:`per_sample_weights`
                                 into consideration. ``"mean"`` computes the average of the values
                                 in the bag, ``"max"`` computes the max value over each bag.
                                 Default: ``"mean"``
        sparse (bool, optional): if ``True``, gradient w.r.t. :attr:`weight` matrix will be a sparse tensor. See
                                 Notes for more details regarding sparse gradients. Note: this option is not
                                 supported when ``mode="max"``.
        include_last_offset (bool, optional): if ``True``, :attr:`offsets` has one additional element, where the last element
                                      is equivalent to the size of `indices`. This matches the CSR format.
        padding_idx (int, optional): If specified, the entries at :attr:`padding_idx` do not contribute to the
                                     gradient; therefore, the embedding vector at :attr:`padding_idx` is not updated
                                     during training, i.e. it remains as a fixed "pad". For a newly constructed
                                     EmbeddingBag, the embedding vector at :attr:`padding_idx` will default to all
                                     zeros, but can be updated to another value to be used as the padding vector.
                                     Note that the embedding vector at :attr:`padding_idx` is excluded from the
                                     reduction.

    Attributes:
        weight (Tensor): the learnable weights of the module of shape `(num_embeddings, embedding_dim)`
                         initialized from :math:`\mathcal{N}(0, 1)`.

    Examples::

        >>> # an EmbeddingBag module containing 10 tensors of size 3
        >>> embedding_sum = nn.EmbeddingBag(10, 3, mode='sum')
        >>> # a batch of 2 samples of 4 indices each
        >>> input = torch.tensor([1, 2, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 9], dtype=torch.long)
        >>> offsets = torch.tensor([0, 4], dtype=torch.long)
        >>> # xdoctest: +IGNORE_WANT("non-deterministic")
        >>> embedding_sum(input, offsets)
        tensor([[-0.8861, -5.4350, -0.0523],
                [ 1.1306, -2.5798, -1.0044]])

        >>> # Example with padding_idx
        >>> embedding_sum = nn.EmbeddingBag(10, 3, mode='sum', padding_idx=2)
        >>> input = torch.tensor([2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 3, 2, 9], dtype=torch.long)
        >>> offsets = torch.tensor([0, 4], dtype=torch.long)
        >>> embedding_sum(input, offsets)
        tensor([[ 0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000],
                [-0.7082,  3.2145, -2.6251]])

        >>> # An EmbeddingBag can be loaded from an Embedding like so
        >>> embedding = nn.Embedding(10, 3, padding_idx=2)
        >>> embedding_sum = nn.EmbeddingBag.from_pretrained(
                embedding.weight,
                padding_idx=embedding.padding_idx,
                mode='sum')
    ]

    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly specified for the API to function correctly.  
    - "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": Pairs of parameters that cannot be used together in a single call due to logical or operational conflicts.  
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" refer to parameter pairs that are not universally mutually exclusive but become incompatible only under specific conditions. In these cases, the mutual exclusion depends on certain value combinations, e.g., the parameters conflict only when both assume particular values or satisfy certain conditions based on their assigned values. Thus, these are a subset of "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" that exhibit conditional, rather than absolute, exclusivity.
    - "Mandatory coexistence parameters": Sets of parameters that must be provided together to ensure valid configuration or meaningful behavior.
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters": When the parameters meet certain conditions, it will prevent the function from running.

    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [This criterion computes the cross entropy loss between input logits
    and target.

    It is useful when training a classification problem with `C` classes.
    If provided, the optional argument :attr:`weight` should be a 1D `Tensor`
    assigning weight to each of the classes.
    This is particularly useful when you have an unbalanced training set.

    The `input` is expected to contain the unnormalized logits for each class (which do `not` need
    to be positive or sum to 1, in general).
    `input` has to be a Tensor of size :math:`(C)` for unbatched input,
    :math:`(minibatch, C)` or :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1` for the
    `K`-dimensional case. The last being useful for higher dimension inputs, such
    as computing cross entropy loss per-pixel for 2D images.

    The `target` that this criterion expects should contain either:

    - Class indices in the range :math:`[0, C)` where :math:`C` is the number of classes; if
      `ignore_index` is specified, this loss also accepts this class index (this index
      may not necessarily be in the class range). The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction`
      set to ``'none'``) loss for this case can be described as:

      .. math::
          \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
          l_n = - w_{y_n} \log \frac{\exp(x_{n,y_n})}{\sum_{c=1}^C \exp(x_{n,c})}
          \cdot \mathbb{1}\{y_n \not= \text{ignore\_index}\}

      where :math:`x` is the input, :math:`y` is the target, :math:`w` is the weight,
      :math:`C` is the number of classes, and :math:`N` spans the minibatch dimension as well as
      :math:`d_1, ..., d_k` for the `K`-dimensional case. If
      :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'`` (default ``'mean'``), then

      .. math::
          \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
              \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{\sum_{n=1}^N w_{y_n} \cdot \mathbb{1}\{y_n \not= \text{ignore\_index}\}} l_n, &
               \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
                \sum_{n=1}^N l_n,  &
                \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
            \end{cases}

      Note that this case is equivalent to applying :class:`~torch.nn.LogSoftmax`
      on an input, followed by :class:`~torch.nn.NLLLoss`.

    - Probabilities for each class; useful when labels beyond a single class per minibatch item
      are required, such as for blended labels, label smoothing, etc. The unreduced (i.e. with
      :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss for this case can be described as:

      .. math::
          \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
          l_n = - \sum_{c=1}^C w_c \log \frac{\exp(x_{n,c})}{\sum_{i=1}^C \exp(x_{n,i})} y_{n,c}

      where :math:`x` is the input, :math:`y` is the target, :math:`w` is the weight,
      :math:`C` is the number of classes, and :math:`N` spans the minibatch dimension as well as
      :math:`d_1, ..., d_k` for the `K`-dimensional case. If
      :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'`` (default ``'mean'``), then

      .. math::
          \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
              \frac{\sum_{n=1}^N l_n}{N}, &
               \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
                \sum_{n=1}^N l_n,  &
                \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
            \end{cases}

    .. note::
        The performance of this criterion is generally better when `target` contains class
        indices, as this allows for optimized computation. Consider providing `target` as
        class probabilities only when a single class label per minibatch item is too restrictive.

    Args:
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to each class.
            If given, has to be a Tensor of size `C` and floating point dtype
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when :attr:`reduce` is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        ignore_index (int, optional): Specifies a target value that is ignored
            and does not contribute to the input gradient. When :attr:`size_average` is
            ``True``, the loss is averaged over non-ignored targets. Note that
            :attr:`ignore_index` is only applicable when the target contains class indices.
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will
            be applied, ``'mean'``: the weighted mean of the output is taken,
            ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in
            the meantime, specifying either of those two args will override
            :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``
        label_smoothing (float, optional): A float in [0.0, 1.0]. Specifies the amount
            of smoothing when computing the loss, where 0.0 means no smoothing. The targets
            become a mixture of the original ground truth and a uniform distribution as described in
            `Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision <https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567>`__. Default: :math:`0.0`.

    Shape:
        - Input: Shape :math:`(C)`, :math:`(N, C)` or :math:`(N, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`
          in the case of `K`-dimensional loss.
        - Target: If containing class indices, shape :math:`()`, :math:`(N)` or :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with
          :math:`K \geq 1` in the case of K-dimensional loss where each value should be between :math:`[0, C)`.
          If containing class probabilities, same shape as the input and each value should be between :math:`[0, 1]`.
        - Output: If reduction is 'none', shape :math:`()`, :math:`(N)` or :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`
          in the case of K-dimensional loss, depending on the shape of the input. Otherwise, scalar.


        where:

        .. math::
            \begin{aligned}
                C ={} & \text{number of classes} \\
                N ={} & \text{batch size} \\

        >>> output = loss(input, target)
        >>> output.backward()

        >>> # Example of target with class probabilities
        >>> input = torch.randn(3, 5, requires_grad=True)
        >>> target = torch.randn(3, 5).softmax(dim=1)
        >>> output = loss(input, target)
        >>> output.backward()

        >>> # Example with ignore_index
        >>> loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(ignore_index=2)
        >>> input = torch.randn(3, 5, requires_grad=True)
        >>> target = torch.tensor([2, 3, 4])
        >>> output = loss(input, target)
        >>> output.backward()

        >>> # Example with label_smoothing
        >>> loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(label_smoothing=0.1)
        >>> input = torch.randn(3, 5, requires_grad=True)
        > target = torch.empty(3, dtype=torch.long).random_(5)
        >>> output = loss(input, target)
        >>> output.backward()

    For arbitrary targets, including those with ignore_index, the loss can be computed as:

    >>> # Example with ignore_index and label_smoothing
    >>> loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(ignore_index=2, label_smoothing=0.1)
    >>> input = torch.randn(3, 5, requires_grad=True)
    >>> target = torch.tensor([2, 3, 4])
    >>> output = loss(input, target)
    >>> output.backward()

    Note that when using label_smoothing, the target is expected to be class indices. If the target is
    probabilities, label_smoothing is ignored.

    .. note::
        This criterion expects the input logits to be unnormalized. If the input is already
        log-probabilities and label_smoothing is non-zero, this criterion applies label smoothing
        incorrectly. Instead, use :class:`~torch.nn.NLLLoss` in this case.
    ]

    (2) User's Problem Statement.

    The user is trying to compute the cross entropy loss for a multi-class classification problem using
    `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`. They have a specific scenario where the target is a probability distribution
    over classes, not just class indices. They are confused about how the loss is computed in this case and
    whether the API supports this mode of operation.

    The user has provided a code snippet where they are using `CrossEntropyLoss` with a target that is a
    probability distribution. They are unsure if this is the correct approach and are seeking clarification
    on how the loss is calculated when the target is not just class indices.

    The user's code is as follows:

    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn

    # Example where target is a probability distribution
    input = torch.randn(3, 5, requires_grad=True)
    target = torch.randn(3, 5).softmax(dim=1)
    loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    output = loss(input, target)
    output.backward()
    ```

    The user is asking:
    - How does `CrossEntropyLoss` handle a target that is a probability distribution?
    - Are there any specific considerations or potential issues when using such a target?
    - What is the mathematical formulation of the loss in this scenario?

    (3) Additional Information.

    The user is working on a project where they need to handle multi-label classification, but they are
    using a probability distribution as the target instead of one-hot encoded vectors. They are concerned
    about the correctness of their approach and whether `CrossEntropyLoss` is suitable for their use case.

    ---
    3. Task:

    Based on the provided API documentation and the user's problem statement, provide a detailed explanation
    of how `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss` handles a target that is a probability distribution. Include the
    mathematical formulation, any specific considerations, and potential issues the user might encounter.
    Also, provide guidance on whether this approach is appropriate for their use case and suggest any
    alternative approaches if necessary.

    The response should be comprehensive, addressing all aspects of the user's questions, and should be
    presented in a clear and structured manner.
</think>

`torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss` is designed to handle both class indices and probability distributions as targets, making it versatile for various classification tasks. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works when the target is a probability distribution, along with considerations and potential issues:

### 1. **Mathematical Formulation**

When the target is a probability distribution, the loss is computed using the following formula:

\[
\ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1, \dots, l_N\}^\top, \quad
l_n = - \sum_{c=1}^C w_c \log \left( \frac{\exp(x_{n,c})}{\sum_{i=1}^C \exp(x_{n,i})} \right) y_{n,c}
\]

Where:
- \( x \) is the input logits.
- \( y \) is the target probability distribution.
- \( w \) is the class weight (if provided).
- \( C \) is the number of classes.
- \( N \) is the batch size.

### 2. **Handling Probability Distributions**

- **Target Shape**: The target must have the same shape as the input. For example, if the input is of shape `(batch_size, num_classes)`, the target should also be `(batch_size, num_classes)`.
- **Normalization**: The target probabilities should sum to 1 for each sample. If not, the loss might not behave as expected.
- **Label Smoothing**: If `label_smoothing` is enabled, it only affects targets provided as class indices. When using probability distributions, label smoothing is ignored.

### 3. **Considerations and Potential Issues**

- **Numerical Stability**: Using very small probabilities in the target can lead to numerical instability, especially when taking the logarithm of near-zero values.
- **Loss Interpretation**: The loss value might be higher than when using hard class indices because the model is penalized for all classes according to their target probabilities.
- **Gradients**: The gradients computed during backpropagation will reflect the model's performance across all classes, which can be beneficial for multi-label tasks but might require careful learning rate tuning.

### 4. **Suitability for Multi-Label Classification**

Using `CrossEntropyLoss` with a probability distribution target is appropriate for scenarios where each sample can belong to multiple classes (multi-label classification) or when dealing with label smoothing. However, for standard multi-class classification, using class indices is more efficient and avoids potential issues with target normalization.

### 5. **Alternative Approaches**

- **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)**: For multi-label tasks, consider using `BCEWithLogitsLoss`, which is more suitable when each class is treated independently.
- **Custom Loss Functions**: If the problem requires a specific type of loss that isn't directly supported by `CrossEntropyLoss`, you can implement a custom loss function.

### 6. **Example Usage**

Here's how you can correctly use `CrossEntropyLoss` with a probability distribution target:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Example where target is a probability distribution
input = torch.randn(3, 5, requires_grad=True)
target = torch.randn(3, 5).softmax(dim=1)  # Ensure probabilities sum to 1
loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
output = loss(input, target)
output.backward()
```

### 7. **Conclusion**

Using `CrossEntropyLoss` with a probability distribution target is valid and can be useful for multi-label or label-smoothed tasks. However, ensure that the target probabilities are properly normalized and consider the implications on loss computation and gradient flow. For standard multi-class classification, using class indices is recommended for efficiency and correctness.

    1. Role:
        You are an expert in [torch], with deep knowledge of its API design, functionality, and practical usage across a wide range of scenarios.

    ---
    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.NLLLoss]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [The negative log likelihood loss. It is useful to train a classification
    problem with `C` classes.

    If provided, the optional argument :attr:`weight` should be a 1D Tensor assigning
    weight to each of the classes. This is particularly useful when you have an
    unbalanced training set.

    The `input` given through a forward call is expected to contain
    log-probabilities of each class. `input` has to be a Tensor of size either
    :math:`(minibatch, C)` or :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)`
    with :math:`K \geq 1` for the `K`-dimensional case. The latter is useful for
    higher dimension inputs, such as computing NLL loss per-pixel for 2D images.

    Obtaining log-probabilities in a neural network is easily achieved by
    adding a  `LogSoftmax`  layer in the last layer of your network.
    You may use `CrossEntropyLoss` instead, if you prefer not to add an extra
    layer.

    The `target` that this loss expects should be a class index in the range :math:`[0, C-1]`
    where `C = number of classes`; if `ignore_index` is specified, this loss also accepts
    this class index (this index may not necessarily be in the class range).

    The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
        l_n = - w_{y_n} x_{n,y_n}, \quad
        w_{c} = \text{weight}[c] \cdot \mathbb{1}\{c \not= \text{ignore\_index}\},

    where :math:`x` is the input, :math:`y` is the target, :math:`w` is the weight, and
    :math:`N` is the batch size. If :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'``
    (default ``'mean'``), then

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
            \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{\sum_{n=1}^N w_{y_n}} l_n, &
            \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
            \sum_{n=1}^N l_n,  &
            \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
        \end{cases}

    Args:
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to each
            class. If given, it has to be a Tensor of size `C`. Otherwise, it is
            treated as if having all ones.
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when :attr:`reduce` is ``False``. Default: ``None``
        ignore_index (int, optional): Specifies a target value that is ignored
            and does not contribute to the input gradient. When
            :attr:`size_average` is ``True``, the loss is averaged over
            non-ignored targets.
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``None``
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will
            be applied, ``'mean'``: the weighted mean of the output is taken,
            ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in
            the meantime, specifying either of those two args will override
            :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``

    Shape::
        - Input: :math:`(N, C)` or :math:`(C)`, where `C = number of classes`, `N = batch size`, or
          :math:`(N, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`
          in the case of `K`-dimensional loss.
        - Target: :math:`(N)` or :math:`()`, where each value is
          :math:`0 \leq \text{targets}[i] \leq C-1`, or
          :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1` in the case of
          K-dimensional loss.
        - Output: If :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, shape :math:`(N)` or
          :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1` in the case of K-dimensional loss.
          Otherwise, scalar.

    Examples::

        >>> log_softmax = nn.LogSoftmax(dim=1)
        >>> loss_fn = nn.NLLLoss()
        >>> # input to NLLLoss is of size N x C = 3 x 5
        >>> input = torch.randn(3, 5, requires_grad=True)
        >>> # each element in target must have 0 <= value < C
        >>> target = torch.tensor([1, 0, 4])
        >>> loss = loss_fn(log_softmax(input), target)
        >>> loss.backward()
        >>>
        >>>
        >>> # 2D loss example (used, for example, with image inputs)
        >>> N, C = 5, 4
        >>> loss_fn = nn.NLLLoss()
        >>> data = torch.randn(N, 16, 10, 10)
        >>> conv = nn.Conv2d(16, C, (3, 3))
        >>> log_softmax = nn.LogSoftmax(dim=1)
        >>> # output of conv forward is of shape [N, C, 8, 8]
        >>> output = log_softmax(conv(data))
        >>> # each element in target must have 0 <= value < C
        >>> target = torch.empty(N, 8, 8, dtype=torch.long).random_(0, C)
        >>> # input to NLLLoss is of size N x C x height (8) x width (8)
        >>> loss = loss_fn(output, target)
        >>> loss.backward()
    ]

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly specified for the API to function correctly.  
    - "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": Pairs of parameters that cannot be used together in a single call due to logical or operational conflicts.  
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" refer to parameter pairs that are not universally mutually exclusive but become incompatible only under specific conditions. In these cases, the mutual exclusion depends on certain value combinations, e.g., the parameters conflict only when both assume particular values or satisfy certain conditions based on their assigned values. Thus, these are a subset of "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" that exhibit conditional, rather than absolute, exclusivity.
    - "Mandatory coexistence parameters": Sets of parameters that must be provided together to ensure valid configuration or meaningful behavior.
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters": When the parameters meet certain conditions, it will prevent the function from running.

    ---

    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.CTCLoss]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [The Connectionist Temporal Classification loss.

    Calculates loss between a continuous (unsegmented) time series and a target sequence. CTCLoss sums over the
    probability of possible alignments of input to target, producing a loss value which is differentiable
    with respect to each input node. The alignment of input to target is assumed to be "many-to-one", which
    limits the length of the target sequence such that it must be :math:`\leq` the input length.

    Args:
        blank (int, optional): blank label. Default :math:`0`.
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the output losses will be divided by the target lengths and
            then the mean over the batch is taken, ``'sum'``: the output losses will be summed.
            Default: ``'mean'``
        zero_infinity (bool, optional):
            Whether to zero infinite losses and the associated gradients.
            Default: ``False``
            Infinite losses mainly occur when the inputs are too short
            to be aligned to the targets.

    Shape:
        - Log_probs: Tensor of size :math:`(T, N, C)` or :math:`(T, C)`,
          where :math:`T = \text{input length}`,
          :math:`N = \text{batch size}`, and
          :math:`C = \text{number of classes (including blank)}`.
          The logarithmized probabilities of the outputs (e.g. obtained with
          :func:`torch.nn.functional.log_softmax`).
        - Targets: Tensor of size :math:`(N, S)` or
          :math:`(\operatorname{sum}(\text{target\_lengths}))`,
          where :math:`N = \text{batch size}` and
          :math:`S = \text{max target length, if shape is } (N, S)`.
          It represents the target sequences. Each element in the target
          sequence is a class index. And the target index cannot be blank (default=0).
          In the :math:`(N, S)` form, targets are padded to the
          length of the longest sequence, and stacked.
          In the :math:`(\operatorname{sum}(\text{target\_lengths}))` form,
          the targets are assumed to be un-padded and
          concatenated within 1 dimension.
        - Input_lengths: Tuple or tensor of size :math:`(N)` or :math:`()`,
          where :math:`N = \text{batch size}`. It represents the lengths of the
          inputs (must each be :math:`\leq T`). And the lengths are specified
          for each sequence to achieve masking under the assumption that sequences
          are padded to equal lengths.
        - Target_lengths: Tuple or tensor of size :math:`(N)` or :math:`()`,
          where :math:`N = \text{batch size}`. It represents lengths of the targets.
          Lengths are specified for each sequence to achieve masking under the
          assumption that sequences are padded to equal lengths. If target shape is
          :math:`(N,S)`, target_lengths are effectively the stop index
          :math:`s_n` for each target sequence, such that ``target_n = targets[n,0:s_n]`` for
          each target in a batch. Lengths must each be :math:`\leq S`
          If the targets are given as a 1d tensor that is the concatenation of individual
          targets, the target_lengths must add up to the total length of the tensor.
        - Output: scalar if :attr:`reduction` is ``'mean'`` (default) or
          ``'sum'``. If :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, then :math:`(N)` if input is batched or
          :math:`()` if input is unbatched, where :math:`N = \text{batch size}`.

    Note:
        In order to use CuDNN, the following must be satisfied: :attr:`targets` must be

    Note:
        In some circumstances when using the CUDA backend with CuDNN, this operator
        may select a nondeterministic algorithm to increase performance. If this is

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly specified for the API to function correctly. These are typically required for the API to perform its intended operation.
    - "Optional Parameters": Parameters that can be omitted, with the API using default values or making assumptions when they are not provided.
    - "Mutually Exclusive Parameters": Parameters that cannot be used together; specifying one excludes the use of another.

    The task is to analyze the [torch.nn.CTCLoss] API and identify the parameter dependencies, categorizing each parameter into one of the above three types.

    (3) Parameter List.

    The parameters of the [torch.nn.CTCLoss] API are as follows:

    - blank
    - reduction
    - zero_infinity

    (4) Additional Notes.

    - The API is part of the [torch.nn] module, which is a high-level module for building neural networks.
    - The API is a loss function, which is used during training to compute the loss between predictions and targets.
    - The API is designed to handle variable-length sequences, which is common in tasks like speech recognition or sequence-to-sequence modeling.
    - The API has specific requirements regarding the shape and type of the input tensors, as detailed in the documentation.

    ---
    3. Task:

    Analyze the [torch.nn.CTCLoss] API and categorize each of its parameters into the three types: "Mandatory Parameters", "Optional Parameters", or "Mutually Exclusive Parameters". Provide a clear and concise explanation for each categorization.

    Additionally, provide a brief explanation of the API's functionality and usage, highlighting the role of each parameter in the computation of the loss.

    Finally, provide a usage example that demonstrates the correct application of the API, including the handling of input and target tensors, their shapes, and the effect of each parameter on the loss computation.

    The response should be structured as follows:

    1. **API Functionality and Usage Explanation**
    2. **Parameter Categorization**
        - Mandatory Parameters
        - Optional Parameters
        - Mutually Exclusive Parameters
    3. **Usage Example**
        - Code Example
        - Explanation of the Example

    The response should be written in English.

### 1. API Functionality and Usage Explanation

The `torch.nn.CTCLoss` API computes the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss, which is used in sequence modeling tasks such as speech recognition. It measures the loss between a continuous time series (e.g., output from an RNN) and a target sequence, allowing for variable-length inputs and targets. The loss is computed by summing over all possible alignments between the input and target sequences, making it differentiable with respect to the inputs.

The API accepts four main arguments: `log_probs`, `targets`, `input_lengths`, and `target_lengths`, along with three optional parameters: `blank`, `reduction`, and `zero_infinity`. The `log_probs` tensor contains the log probabilities of each class at each time step, `targets` is the sequence of target labels, and `input_lengths` and `target_lengths` specify the lengths of each sequence in the batch to handle padding.

### 2. Parameter Categorization

#### Mandatory Parameters
- **log_probs**: The input tensor of log probabilities. This is mandatory as the loss cannot be computed without it.
- **targets**: The target sequence tensor. This is required to compare against the input probabilities.
- **input_lengths**: Specifies the valid lengths of each input sequence in the batch. Mandatory to handle variable-length inputs.
- **target_lengths**: Specifies the valid lengths of each target sequence in the batch. Mandatory to handle variable-length targets.

#### Optional Parameters
- **blank**: The index of the blank label. Default is 0. This is optional as the API assumes a default blank label.
- **reduction**: Specifies the reduction method for the loss. Options are 'none', 'mean', or 'sum'. Default is 'mean'. This is optional as the API uses a default reduction method.
- **zero_infinity**: A boolean indicating whether to zero out infinite losses. Default is False. This is optional as the API handles infinite losses by default.

#### Mutually Exclusive Parameters
There are no mutually exclusive parameters in this API. All parameters can be used together without conflict.

### 3. Usage Example

#### Code Example
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Initialize the CTC Loss function
ctc_loss = nn.CTCLoss(blank=0, reduction='mean', zero_infinity=True)

# Define input sizes
T = 50  # Input sequence length
C = 20  # Number of classes including blank
N = 16  # Batch size
S = 30  # Target sequence length (padded)

# Create random input tensor of shape (T, N, C)
input = torch.randn(T, N, C).log_softmax(2).requires_grad_()

# Create random target tensor of shape (N, S)
target = torch.randint(low=1, high=C, size=(N, S), dtype=torch.long)

# Input lengths (all sequences are of length T)
input_lengths = torch.full(size=(N,), fill_value=T, dtype=torch.long)

# Target lengths (random lengths between 1 and S)
target_lengths = torch.randint(low=1, high=S, size=(N,), dtype=torch.long)

# Compute CTC loss
loss = ctc_loss(input, target, input_lengths, target_lengths)

# Backward pass
loss.backward()
```

#### Explanation of the Example
- **Input Tensor (`input`)**: A tensor of shape (T, N, C) where T is the sequence length, N is the batch size, and C is the number of classes. The log_softmax is applied to ensure valid log probabilities.
- **Target Tensor (`target`)**: A tensor of shape (N, S) where each element is a class index. The targets are padded to the maximum length S.
- **Input Lengths (`input_lengths`)**: A tensor specifying the valid length of each input sequence. Here, all inputs are of length T.
- **Target Lengths (`target_lengths`)**: A tensor specifying the valid length of each target sequence. These lengths are randomly generated between 1 and S.
- **CTC Loss Parameters**: `blank` is set to 0, `reduction` is 'mean' to average the loss over the batch, and `zero_infinity` is True to handle cases where the input is too short to align with the target.

This example demonstrates how to compute the CTC loss for a batch of sequences, handling variable lengths and applying the specified reduction and blank label.

    1. Role:
        You are an expert in [torch], with deep knowledge of its API design, functionality, and practical usage across a wide range of scenarios.

    ---
    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [This loss combines a `Sigmoid` layer and the `BCELoss` in one single
    class. This version is more numerically stable than using a plain `Sigmoid`
    followed by a `BCELoss` as, by combining the operations into one layer,
    we take advantage of the log-sum-exp trick for numerical stability.

    The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
        l_n = - w_n \left[ y_n \cdot \log \sigma(x_n)
        + (1 - y_n) \cdot \log (1 - \sigma(x_n)) \right],

    where :math:`N` is the batch size. If :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'``
    (default ``'mean'``), then

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
            \operatorname{mean}(L), & \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
            \operatorname{sum}(L),  & \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
        \end{cases}

    This is used for measuring the error of a reconstruction in for example
    an auto-encoder. Note that the targets `t[i]` should be numbers
    between 0 and 1.

    It's possible to trade off recall and precision by adding weights to positive examples.
    In the case of multi-label classification the loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell_c(x, y) = L_c = \{l_{1,c},\dots,l_{N,c}\}^\top, \quad
        l_{n,c} = - w_{n,c} \left[ p_c y_{n,c} \cdot \log \sigma(x_{n,c})
        + (1 - y_{n,c}) \cdot \log (1 - \sigma(x_{n,c})) \right],

    where :math:`c` is the class number (:math:`c > 1` for multi-label binary classification,
    :math:`c = 1` for single-label binary classification),
    :math:`n` is the number of the sample in the batch and
    :math:`p_c` is the weight of the positive answer for the class :math:`c`.

    :math:`p_c > 1` increases the recall, :math:`p_c < 1` increases the precision.

    For example, if a dataset contains 100 positive and 300 negative examples of a single class,
    then ``pos_weight`` for the class should be equal to :math:`\frac{300}{100}=3`.
    The loss would act as if the dataset contains :math:`3\times 100=300` positive examples.

    Examples::

        >>> target = torch.ones([10, 64], dtype=torch.float32)  # 64 classes, batch size = 10
        >>> output = torch.full([10, 64], 1.5)  # A prediction (logit)
        >>> pos_weight = torch.ones([64])  # All weights are equal to 1
        >>> criterion = torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss(pos_weight=pos_weight)
        >>> criterion(output, target)  # -log(sigmoid(1.5))
        tensor(0.20...)

    In the above example, the ``pos_weight`` tensor's elements correspond to the 64 distinct classes
    in a multi-label binary classification scenario. Each element in ``pos_weight`` is designed to adjust the
    loss function based on the imbalance between negative and positive samples for the respective class.
    This approach is useful in datasets with varying levels of class imbalance, ensuring that the loss
    calculation accurately accounts for the distribution in each class.

    Args:
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to the loss
            of each batch element. If given, has to be a Tensor of size `nbatch`.
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when :attr:`reduce` is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
            specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``
        pos_weight (Tensor, optional): a weight of positive examples to be broadcasted with target.
            Must be a tensor with equal size along the class dimension to the number of classes.
            Pay close attention to PyTorch's broadcasting semantics in order to achieve the desired
            operations. For a target of size [B, C, H, W] (where B is batch size) pos_weight of
            size [B, C, H, W] will apply different pos_weights to each element of the batch or
            [C, H, W] the same pos_weights across the batch. To apply the same positive weight
            along all spacial dimensions for a 2D multi-class target [C, H, W] use: [C, 1, 1].
            Default: ``None``

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(*)`, where :math:`*` means any number of dimensions.
        - Target: :math:`(*)`, same shape as the input.
        - Output: scalar. If :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, then :math:`(*)`, same
          shape as input.

     Examples::

        >>> loss = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
        >>> input = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
        >>> target = torch.empty(3).random_(2)
        >>> output = loss(input, target)
        >>> output.backward()
    ]

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly specified for the API to function correctly.  
    - "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": Pairs of parameters that cannot be used together in a single call due to logical or operational conflicts.  
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" refer to parameter pairs that are not universally mutually exclusive but become incompatible only under specific conditions. In these cases, the mutual exclusion depends on certain value combinations, e.g., the parameters conflict only when both assume particular values or satisfy certain conditions based on their assigned values. Thus, these are a subset of "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" that exhibit conditional, rather than absolute, exclusivity.
    - "Mandatory coexistence parameters": Sets of parameters that must be provided together to ensure valid configuration or meaningful behavior.
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters": When the parameters meet certain conditions, it will prevent the function from running.

    ---
    3. Your Tasks:

    Based on the documentation and definitions provided:

    1. Determine the Type of Each Parameter.
    For each explicitly defined parameter in [fun_string], determine its type, such as: tensor, int, str, optional tensor, etc.
    2. Identify Parameter Dependency Structures as accurately and completely as possible:
    - List all "Mandatory Parameters"  
    - Identify any "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs"  
    - Identify any "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" 
    - Identify any "Mandatory Coexistence Parameters"

    ---
    4.Output Format:
    
    {
    "Parameter type": {
        "input": "...",
        "weight": "...",
        "bias": "...",
        ...
    },
    "Parameter dependencies": {
        "Mandatory Parameters": ["param1", "param2", ...],
        "Mutual Exclusion Pairs": [["paramA", "paramB"], ["paramC", "paramD"], ...],
        "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Pairs": [["paramA", "paramB", "condition"], ...],
        "Mandatory Coexistence Parameters": [["paramA", "paramB"], ...]
    }
    }

    Note: For the "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Pairs", the condition should be a string that describes when the mutual exclusion applies. For example, "if paramA is not None and paramB is not None, then they cannot be used together".

    1. Role:
        You are an expert in [torch], with deep knowledge of its API design, functionality, and practical usage across a wide range of scenarios.

    ---
    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.TripletMarginWithDistanceLoss]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [Creates a criterion that measures the triplet loss given input
    tensors :math:`a`, :math:`p`, and :math:`n` (representing anchor,
    positive, and negative examples, respectively), and a nonnegative,
    real-valued function ("distance function") used to compute the relationship
    between the anchor and positive example ("positive distance") and the
    anchor and negative example ("negative distance").

    The unreduced loss (i.e., with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``)
    can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell(a, p, n) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
        l_i = \max \{d(a_i, p_i) - d(a_i, n_i) + {\rm margin}, 0\}

    where :math:`N` is the batch size; :math:`d` is a nonnegative, real-valued function
    quantifying the closeness of two tensors, referred to as the :attr:`distance_function`;
    and :math:`margin` is a nonnegative margin representing the minimum difference
    between the positive and negative distances that is required for the loss to
    be 0.  The input tensors have :math:`N` elements each and can be of any shape
    that the distance function can handle.

    If :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'``
    (default ``'mean'``), then:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) =
        \begin{cases}
            \operatorname{mean}(L), &  \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
            \operatorname{sum}(L),  &  \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
        \end{cases}

    See also :class:`~torch.nn.TripletMarginLoss`, which computes the triplet
    loss for input tensors using the :math:`l_p` distance as the distance function.

    Args:
        distance_function (Callable, optional): A nonnegative, real-valued function that
            quantifies the closeness of two tensors. If not specified,
            `nn.PairwiseDistance` will be used.  Default: ``None``
        margin (float, optional): A nonnegative margin representing the minimum difference
            between the positive and negative distances required for the loss to be 0. Larger
            margins penalize cases where the negative examples are not distant enough from the
            anchors, relative to the positives. Default: :math:`1`.
        swap (bool, optional): Whether to use the distance swap described in the paper
            `Learning shallow convolutional feature descriptors with triplet losses` by
            V. Balntas, E. Riba et al. If True, and if the positive example is closer to the
            negative example than the anchor is, swaps the positive example and the anchor in
            the loss computation. Default: ``False``.
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the (optional) reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Default: ``'mean'``


    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, *)` where :math:`*` represents any number of additional dimensions
          as supported by the distance function.
        - Output: A Tensor of shape :math:`(N)` if :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, or a scalar
          otherwise.

    Examples::

    >>> # Initialize embeddings
    >>> embedding = nn.Embedding(1000, 128)
    >>> anchor_ids = torch.randint(0, 1000, (1,))
    >>> positive_ids = torch.randint(0, 1000, (1,))
    >>> negative_ids = torch.randint(0, 1000, (1,))
    >>> anchor = embedding(anchor_ids)
    >>> positive = embedding(positive_ids)
    >>> negative = embedding(negative_ids)
    >>>
    >>> # Built-in Distance Function
    >>> triplet_loss = \
    >>>     nn.TripletMarginWithDistanceLoss(distance_function=nn.PairwiseDistance())
    >>> output = triplet_loss(anchor, positive, negative)
    >>> output.backward()
    >>>
    >>> # Custom Distance Function
    >>> def l_infinity(x1, x2):
    >>>     return torch.max(torch.abs(x1 - x2), dim=1).values
    >>>
    >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("FIXME: Would call backwards a second time")
    >>> triplet_loss = (
    >>>     nn.TripletMarginWithDistanceLoss(distance_function=l_infinity, margin=1.5))
    >>> output = triplet_loss(anchor, positive, negative)
    >>> output.backward()
    >>>
    >>> # Custom Distance Function (Lambda)
    >>> triplet_loss = (
    >>>     nn.TripletMarginWithDistanceLoss(
    >>>         distance_function=lambda x, y: 1.0 - F.cosine_similarity(x, y)))
    >>> output = triplet_loss(anchor, positive, negative)
    >>> output.backward()

    ]

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly specified for the API to function correctly.  
    - "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": Pairs of parameters that cannot be used together in a single call due to logical or operational conflicts.  
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" refer to parameter pairs that are not universally mutually exclusive but become incompatible only under specific conditions. In these cases, the mutual exclusion depends on certain value combinations, e.g., the parameters conflict only when both assume particular values or satisfy certain conditions based on their assigned values. Thus, these are a subset of "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" that exhibit conditional, rather than absolute, exclusivity.
    - "Mandatory coexistence parameters": Sets of parameters that must be provided together to ensure valid configuration or meaningful behavior.
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters": When the parameters meet certain conditions, it will prevent the function from running.

    ---
    3. Your Tasks:

    Based on the documentation and definitions provided:

    1. Determine the Type of Each Parameter.
    For each explicitly defined parameter in [fun_string], determine its type, such as: tensor, int, str, optional tensor, etc.
    2. Identify Parameter Dependency Structures as accurately and completely as possible:
    - List all "Mandatory Parameters"  
    - Identify any "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs"  
    - Identify any "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" 
    - Identify any "Mandatory Coexistence Parameters"

    ---
    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.Upsample]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [Upsamples a given multi-channel 1D (temporal), 2D (spatial) or 3D (volumetric) data.

    The input data is assumed to be of the form
    `minibatch x channels x [optional depth] x [optional height] x width`.
    Hence, for spatial inputs, we expect a 4D Tensor and for volumetric inputs, we expect a 5D Tensor.

    The algorithms available for upsampling are nearest neighbor and linear,
    bilinear, bicubic and trilinear for 3D, 4D and 5D input Tensor,
    respectively.

    One can either give a :attr:`scale_factor` or the target output :attr:`size` to
    calculate the output size. (You cannot give both, as it is ambiguous)

    Args:
        size (int or Tuple[int] or Tuple[int, int] or Tuple[int, int, int], optional):
            output spatial sizes
        scale_factor (float or Tuple[float] or Tuple[float, float] or Tuple[float, float, float], optional):
            multiplier for spatial size. Has to match input size if it is a tuple.
        mode (str, optional): the upsampling algorithm: one of ``'nearest'``,
            ``'linear'``, ``'bilinear'``, ``'bicubic'`` and ``'trilinear'``.
            Default: ``'nearest'``
        align_corners (bool, optional): if ``True``, the corner pixels of the input
            and output tensors are aligned, and thus preserving the values at
            those pixels. This only has effect when :attr:`mode` is
            ``'linear'``, ``'bilinear'``, ``'bicubic'``, or ``'trilinear'``.
            Default: ``False``
        recompute_scale_factor (bool, optional): recompute the scale_factor for use in the
            interpolation calculation. If `recompute_scale_factor` is ``True``, then
            `scale_factor` must be passed in and `scale_factor` is used to compute the
            output `size`. The computed output `size` will be used to infer new scales for
            the interpolation. Note that when `scale_factor` is floating-point, it may differ
            from the recomputed `scale_factor` due to rounding and precision issues.
            If `recompute_scale_factor` is ``False``, then `size` or `scale_factor` will
            be used directly for interpolation.

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, C, W_{in})`, :math:`(N, C, H_{in}, W_{in})` or :math:`(N, C, D_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in})`
        - Output: :math:`(N, C, W_{out})`, :math:`(N, C, H_{out}, W_{out})`
          or :math:`(N, C, D_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out})`, where

    .. math::
        D_{out} = \left\lfloor D_{in} \times \text{scale\_factor} \right\rfloor

    .. math::
        H_{out} = \left\lfloor H_{in} \times \text{scale\_factor} \right\rfloor

    .. math::
        W_{out} = \left\lfloor W_{in} \times \text{scale\_factor} \right\rfloor

    .. warning::
        With ``align_corners = True``, the linearly interpolating modes
        (`linear`, `bilinear`, `bicubic`, and `trilinear`) don't proportionally
        align the output and input pixels, and thus the output values can depend
        on the input size. This was the default behavior for these modes up to
        version 0.3.1. Since then, the default behavior is
        ``align_corners = False``. See below for concrete examples on how this
        affects the outputs.

    .. note::
        If you want downsampling/general resizing, you should use :func:`~nn.functional.interpolate`.

    Examples::

        >>> input = torch.arange(1, 5, dtype=torch.float32).view(1, 1, 2, 2)
        >>> input
        tensor([[[[1., 2.],
                  [3., 4.]]]])

    1. Role:
        You are an expert in [torch], with deep knowledge of its API design, functionality, and practical usage across a wide range of scenarios.

    ---
    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [Implement distributed data parallelism based on ``torch.distributed`` at module level.

    This container provides data parallelism by synchronizing gradients
    across each model replica. The devices to synchronize across are
    specified by the input ``process_group``, which is the entire world
    by default. Note that ``DistributedDataParallel`` does not chunk or
    otherwise shard the input across participating GPUs; the user is
    responsible for defining how to do so, for example through the use
    of a :class:`DistributedSampler`.

    See also: :ref:`distributed-basics` and :ref:`cuda-nn-ddp-instead`.
    The same constraints on input as in :class:`torch.nn.DataParallel` apply.

    Creation of this class requires that ``torch.distributed`` to be already
    initialized, by calling :func:`torch.distributed.init_process_group`.

    ``DistributedDataParallel`` is proven to be significantly faster than
    :class:`torch.nn.DataParallel` for single-node multi-GPU data
    parallel training.

    To use ``DistributedDataParallel`` on a host with N GPUs, you should spawn
    up ``N`` processes, ensuring that each process exclusively works on a single
    GPU from 0 to N-1. This can be done by either setting
    ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` for every process or by calling:

        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("undefined variables")
        >>> torch.cuda.set_device(i)

    where i is from 0 to N-1. In each process, you should refer the following
    to construct this module:

        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("undefined variables")
        >>> torch.distributed.init_process_group(
        >>>     backend='nccl', world_size=N, init_method='...'
        >>> )
        >>> model = DistributedDataParallel(model, device_ids=[i], output_device=i)

    In order to spawn up multiple processes per node, you can use either
    ``torch.distributed.launch`` or ``torch.multiprocessing.spawn``.

    .. note::
        Please refer to `PyTorch Distributed Overview <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dist_overview.html>`__
        for a brief introduction to all features related to distributed training.

    .. note::
        ``DistributedDataParallel`` can be used in conjunction with
        :class:`torch.distributed.optim.ZeroRedundancyOptimizer` to reduce
        per-rank optimizer states memory footprint. Please refer to
        `ZeroRedundancyOptimizer recipe <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/zero_redundancy_optimizer.html>`__
        for more details.

    .. note:: ``nccl`` backend is currently the fastest and highly recommended
        backend when using GPUs. This applies to both single-node and
        multi-node distributed training.

    .. note:: This module also supports mixed-precision distributed training.
        This means that your model can have different types of parameters such
        as mixed types of ``fp16`` and ``fp32``, the gradient reduction on these
        mixed types of parameters will just work fine.

    .. note:: If you use ``torch.save`` on one process to checkpoint the module,
        and ``torch.load`` on some other processes to recover it, make sure that
        ``map_location`` is configured properly for every process. Without
        ``map_location``, ``torch.load`` would recover the module to devices
        where the module was saved from.

    .. note:: When a model is trained on ``M`` nodes with ``batch=N``, the
        gradient will be ``M`` times smaller when compared to the same model
        trained on a single node with ``batch=M*N`` if the loss is summed (NOT
        averaged as usual) across instances in a batch (because the gradients
        between different nodes are averaged). You should take this into
        consideration when you want to obtain a mathematically equivalent
        training process compared to the local training counterpart. But in most
        cases, you can just treat a DistributedDataParallel wrapped model, a
        DataParallel wrapped model and an ordinary model on a single GPU as the
        same (E.g. using the same learning rate for equivalent batch size).

    .. note::
        Parameters are never broadcast between processes. The module performs
        an all-reduce step on gradients and assumes that they will be modified
        by the optimizer in all processes in the same way. Buffers
        (e.g. BatchNorm stats) are broadcast from the module in process of rank
        0, to all other replicas in the system in every iteration.

    .. note::
        If you are using DistributedDataParallel in conjunction with the
        :ref:`distributed-rpc-framework`, you should always use
        :meth:`torch.distributed.autograd.backward` to compute gradients and
        :class:`torch.distributed.optim.DistributedOptimizer` for optimizing
        parameters.

        Example::

            >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("undefined variables")
            >>> import torch.distributed.autograd as dist_autograd
            >>> from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP
            >>> import torch
            >>> from torch import optim
            >>> from torch.distributed.optim import DistributedOptimizer
            >>> import torch.distributed.rpc as rpc
            >>> from torch.distributed.rpc import RRef
            >>>
            >>> t1 = torch.rand((3, 3), requires_grad=True)
            >>> t2 = torch.rand((3, 3), requires_grad=True)
            >>> rref = rpc.remote("worker1", torch.add, args=(t1, t2))
            >>> ddp_model = DDP(my_model)
            >>>
            >>> # Setup optimizer
            >>> optimizer_params = [rref]
            >>> for param in ddp_model.parameters():
            >>>     optimizer_params.append(RRef(param))
            >>>
            >>> dist_optim = DistributedOptimizer(
            >>>     optim.SGD,
            >>>     optimizer_params,
            >>>     lr=0.05,
            >>> )
            >>>
            >>> with dist_autograd.context() as context_id:
            >>>     pred = ddp_model(rref.to_here())
            >>>     loss = loss_func(pred, target)
            >>>     dist_autograd.backward(context_id, [loss])
            >>>     dist_optim.step(context_id)

    .. note::
        DistributedDataParallel currently offers limited support for gradient
        checkpointing with :meth:`torch.utils.checkpoint`.
        If the checkpoint is done with use_reentrant=False (recommended), DDP
        will work as expected without any limitations.
        If, however, the checkpoint is done with use_reentrant=True (the default),
        DDP will work as expected when there are no unused parameters in the model
        and each layer is checkpointed at most once (make sure you are not passing
        `find_unused_parameters=True` to DDP). We currently do not support the
        case where a layer is checkpointed multiple times, or when there unused
        parameters in the checkpointed model.

    .. note::
        To let a non-DDP model load a state dict from a DDP model,
        :meth:`~torch.nn.modules.utils.consume_prefix_in_state_dict_if_present`
        needs to be applied to strip the prefix "module." in the DDP state dict before loading.

    .. warning::
        Constructor, forward method, and differentiation of the output (or a
        function of the output of this module) are distributed synchronization
        points. Take that into account in case different processes might be
        executing different code.

    .. warning::
        This module assumes all parameters are registered in the model by the
        time it is created. No parameters should be added nor removed later.
        Same applies to buffers.

    .. warning::
        This module assumes all parameters are registered in the model of each
        distributed processes are in the same order. The module itself will
        conduct gradient ``allreduce`` following the reverse order of the
        registered parameters of the model. In other words, it is users'
        responsibility to ensure that each distributed process has the exact
        same model and thus the exact same parameter registration order.

    .. warning::
        This module allows parameters with non-rowmajor-contiguous strides.
        For example, your model may contain some parameters whose
        :class:`torch.memory_format` is ``torch.contiguous_format``
        and others whose format is ``torch.channels_last``.  However,
        corresponding parameters in different processes must have the
        same strides.

    .. warning::
        This module doesn't work with :func:`torch.autograd.grad` (i.e. it will
        only work if gradients are to be accumulated in ``.grad`` attributes of
        parameters).

    .. warning::
        If you plan on using this module with a ``nccl`` backend or a ``gloo``
        backend (that uses Infiniband), together with a DataLoader that uses
        multiple workers, please change the multiprocessing start method to
        ``forkserver`` (Python 3 only) or ``spawn``. Unfortunately
        Gloo (that uses Infiniband) and NCCL2 are not fork safe, and you will
        get deadlocks if you use the default fork method. You can set the
        multiprocessing start method as follows:

        >>> import multiprocessing
        >>> multiprocessing.set_start_method('spawn')

        or

        >>> import multiprocessing
        >>> multiprocessing.set_start_method('forkserver')

        Note that this is only necessary if you are using multiple workers in
        the DataLoader. If you are using the default (single worker), then you
        can safely ignore this.

    .. warning::
        If you are using this module with the ``gloo`` backend, you must ensure
        that the process group is initialized with the same number of processes

    1. Role:
        You are an expert in [torch], with deep knowledge of its API design, functionality, and practical usage across a wide range of scenarios.

    ---
    2. Background and Context:

    (1) API Documentation.

    We provide below the official documentation for the API to be analyzed: 
    [torch.nn.modules.lazy.LazyModuleMixin]
    This documentation specifies the API’s function signature, behavior, supported data types, argument definitions, default values, constraints, and usage examples, enabling precise understanding of its operational semantics.
    The specific API documentation content is as below:
    [A mixin for modules that lazily initialize parameters, also known as "lazy modules".

    .. warning:
        Lazy modules are an experimental new feature under active development,
        and their API is likely to change.

    Modules that lazily initialize parameters, or "lazy modules",
    derive the shapes of their parameters from the first input(s)
    to their forward method. Until that first forward they contain
    :class:`torch.nn.UninitializedParameter` s that should not be accessed
    or used, and afterward they contain regular :class:`torch.nn.Parameter` s.
    Lazy modules are convenient since they don't require computing some
    module arguments, like the :attr:`in_features` argument of a
    typical :class:`torch.nn.Linear`.

    After construction, networks with lazy modules should first
    be converted to the desired dtype and placed on the expected device.
    This is because lazy modules only perform shape inference so the usual dtype
    and device placement behavior applies.
    The lazy modules should then perform "dry runs" to initialize all the components in the module.
    These "dry runs" send inputs of the correct size, dtype, and device through
    the network and to each one of its lazy modules. After this the network can be used as usual.

    >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP
    >>> class LazyMLP(torch.nn.Module):
    ...    def __init__(self) -> None:
    ...        super().__init__()
    ...        self.fc1 = torch.nn.LazyLinear(10)
    ...        self.relu1 = torch.nn.ReLU()
    ...        self.fc2 = torch.nn.LazyLinear(1)
    ...        self.relu2 = torch.nn.ReLU()
    ...
    ...    def forward(self, input):
    ...        x = self.relu1(self.fc1(input))
    ...        y = self.relu2(self.fc2(x))
    ...        return y
    >>> # constructs a network with lazy modules
    >>> lazy_mlp = LazyMLP()
    >>> # transforms the network's device and dtype
    >>> # NOTE: these transforms can and should be applied after construction and before any 'dry runs'
    >>> lazy_mlp = lazy_mlp.cuda().double()
    >>> lazy_mlp
    LazyMLP( (fc1): LazyLinear(in_features=0, out_features=10, bias=True)
      (relu1): ReLU()
      (fc2): LazyLinear(in_features=0, out_features=1, bias=True)
      (relu2): ReLU()
    )
    >>> # performs a dry run to initialize the network's lazy modules
    >>> lazy_mlp(torch.ones(10,10).cuda())
    >>> # after initialization, LazyLinear modules become regular Linear modules
    >>> lazy_mlp
    LazyMLP(
      (fc1): Linear(in_features=10, out_features=10, bias=True)
      (relu1): ReLU()
      (fc2): Linear(in_features=10, out_features=1, bias=True)
      (relu2): ReLU()
    )
    >>> # attaches an optimizer, since parameters can now be used as usual
    >>> optim = torch.optim.SGD(mlp.parameters(), lr=0.01)

    A final caveat when using lazy modules is that the order of initialization of a network's
    parameters may change, since the lazy modules are always initialized after other modules.
    For example, if the LazyMLP class defined above had a :class:`torch.nn.LazyLinear` module
    first and then a regular :class:`torch.nn.Linear` second, the second module would be
    initialized on construction and the first module would be initialized during the first dry run.
    This can cause the parameters of a network using lazy modules to be initialized differently
    than the parameters of a network without lazy modules as the order of parameter initializations,
    which often depends on a stateful random number generator, is different.
    Check :doc:`/notes/randomness` for more details.

    Lazy modules can be serialized with a state dict like other modules. For example:

    >>> lazy_mlp = LazyMLP()
    >>> # The state dict shows the uninitialized parameters
    >>> lazy_mlp.state_dict()
    OrderedDict([('fc1.weight', Uninitialized parameter),
                 ('fc1.bias',
                  tensor([-1.8832e+25,  4.5636e-41, -1.8832e+25,  4.5636e-41, -6.1598e-30,
                           4.5637e-41, -1.8788e+22,  4.5636e-41, -2.0042e-31,  4.5637e-41])),
                 ('fc2.weight', Uninitialized parameter),
                 ('fc2.bias', tensor([0.0019]))])


    Lazy modules can load regular :class:`torch.nn.Parameter` s (i.e. you can serialize/deserialize
    initialized LazyModules and they will remain initialized)


    >>> full_mlp = LazyMLP()
    >>> # Dry run to initialize another module
    >>> full_mlp.forward(torch.ones(10, 1))
    >>> # Load an initialized state into a lazy module
    >>> lazy_mlp.load_state_dict(full_mlp.state_dict())
    >>> # The state dict now holds valid values
    >>> lazy_mlp.state_dict()
    OrderedDict([('fc1.weight',
                  tensor([[-0.3837],
                          [ 0.0907],
                          [ 0.6708],
                          [-0.5223],
                          [-0.9028],
                          [ 0.2851],
                          [-0.4537],
                          [ 0.6813],
                          [ 0.5766],
                          [-0.8678]])),
                 ('fc1.bias',
                  tensor([-1.8832e+25,  4.5636e-41, -1.8832e+25,  4.5636e-41, -6.1598e-30,
                           4.5637e-41, -1.8788e+22,  4.5636e-41, -2.0042e-31,  4.5637e-41])),
                 ('fc2.weight',
                  tensor([[ 0.1320,  0.2938,  0.0679,  0.2793,  0.1088, -0.1795, -0.2301,  0.2807,
                            0.2479,  0.1091]])),
                 ('fc2.bias', tensor([0.0019]))])

    Note, however, that the loaded parameters will not be replaced when doing a "dry run" if they are initialized
    when the state is loaded. This prevents using initialized modules in different contexts.
    ]

    (2) Parameter Dependency Types.

    In deep learning libraries such as [torch], many APIs accept a set of configurable parameters, enabling multiple usage patterns based on different parameter combinations. 
    These parameters may exhibit various types of interdependencies that govern valid and efficient usage. Specifically, we consider the following three relationship types:

    - "Mandatory Parameters": Parameters that must be explicitly specified for the API to function correctly.  
    - "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs": Pairs of parameters that cannot be used together in a single call due to logical or operational conflicts.  
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" refer to parameter pairs that are not universally mutually exclusive but become incompatible only under specific conditions. In these cases, the mutual exclusion depends on certain value combinations, e.g., the parameters conflict only when both assume particular values or satisfy certain conditions based on their assigned values. Thus, these are a subset of "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs" that exhibit conditional, rather than absolute, exclusivity.
    - "Mandatory coexistence parameters": Sets of parameters that must be provided together to ensure valid configuration or meaningful behavior.
    - "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameters": When the parameters meet certain conditions, it will prevent the function from running.

    ---
    3. Your Tasks:

    Based on the documentation and definitions provided:

    1. Determine the Type of Each Parameter.
    For each explicitly defined parameter in [fun_string], determine its type, such as: tensor, int, str, optional tensor, etc.
    2. Identify Parameter Dependency Structures as accurately and completely as possible:
    - List all "Mandatory Parameters"  
    - Identify any "Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs"  
    - Identify any "Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs"  
    - Identify any "Mandatory coexistence parameters"  
    3. Provide a detailed explanation for each identified dependency structure, including the reasoning behind it.

    The function to analyze is [torch.nn.modules.lazy.LazyModuleMixin].

    Note: The function in question is a mixin, not a standalone function. Therefore, it's important to analyze its usage and dependencies as part of a module.

### Analysis of `torch.nn.modules.lazy.LazyModuleMixin`

The `LazyModuleMixin` is a mixin class designed for modules that lazily initialize their parameters. This means that the parameters are not initialized until the first forward pass, allowing for more flexible module definitions without specifying certain dimensions upfront.

#### 1. Parameter Types

The `LazyModuleMixin` itself does not have explicit parameters in its constructor. Instead, it is used as a base class for other modules (e.g., `LazyLinear`) that incorporate lazy initialization. The parameters of these derived modules are typically:

- `out_features`: An integer specifying the number of output features.
- `bias`: A boolean indicating whether to include a bias term.

These parameters are inherited from the base module classes (e.g., `Linear` in the case of `LazyLinear`).

#### 2. Parameter Dependency Structures

- **Mandatory Parameters**: 
  - `out_features`: This is a mandatory parameter for modules like `LazyLinear` because it determines the output dimension, which is necessary for parameter initialization once the input shape is known.
  
- **Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs**: 
  - There are no explicit mutual exclusion pairs in the `LazyModuleMixin` itself. However, in derived modules, certain parameters might be mutually exclusive. For example, in `LazyLinear`, `bias` is a boolean and does not conflict with other parameters.

- **Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs**: 
  - No conditional mutual exclusions are present in the `LazyModuleMixin` or its derived modules.

- **Mandatory Coexistence Parameters**: 
  - In derived modules like `LazyLinear`, `out_features` and `bias` must be provided together to define the module's behavior. However, `bias` is optional in many cases, so it is not strictly a mandatory coexistence parameter.

#### 3. Detailed Explanations

- **Mandatory Parameters**: 
  - `out_features` is mandatory because it defines the output dimension, which is crucial for initializing the weights and bias (if applicable) once the input shape is determined during the first forward pass.

- **Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs**: 
  - The `LazyModuleMixin` does not introduce any new parameters, so mutual exclusions are not applicable here. However, in derived modules, parameters are designed to work together without conflicts.

- **Conditional Mutual Exclusion Parameter Pairs**: 
  - Since the mixin does not introduce new parameters, there are no conditional mutual exclusions. The derived modules handle their own parameter dependencies.

- **Mandatory Coexistence Parameters**: 
  - While `out_features` is mandatory, `bias` is optional. Therefore, they do not strictly coexist, but together they define the module's structure.

### Conclusion

The `LazyModuleMixin` is designed to enable lazy initialization of module parameters, allowing for more flexible network definitions. The derived modules, such as `LazyLinear`, incorporate this mixin and define their own parameters, with `out_features` being a mandatory parameter. There are no mutual exclusions or mandatory coexistence parameters introduced by the mixin itself, but derived modules may have their own parameter dependencies.
